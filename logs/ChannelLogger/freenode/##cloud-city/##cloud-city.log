2021-05-12T17:05:04  <daftykins> heh yeah i've never done anything like that with Mischief, but she's a senior cat and knows what's up
2021-05-12T17:05:32  <ectospasm> Ford isn't that destructive, so there's no need to.

2021-05-12T18:47:40  <bazkie> i know right?!
2021-05-12T18:47:45  <bazkie> why didn't i come up with that before
2021-05-12T18:47:48  <daftykins> are you rich from Ballsy yet?
2021-05-12T18:47:54  <bazkie> lol no
2021-05-12T18:48:02  <Anastasius> Because we're morons.

2021-05-12T18:48:48  <Anastasius> Oh hopefully we're not mormons.
2021-05-12T18:49:00  <bazkie> yeah sounds dreadful
2021-05-12T18:49:09  <bazkie> you know i'd probably rather be amish

2021-05-12T18:49:39  <Anastasius> Anxiety attacks and insomnia.
2021-05-12T18:49:42  <bazkie> ugh
2021-05-12T18:49:59  <Anastasius> It's okay, the past week or so has been better, aside from the nightmares.
2021-05-12T18:49:59  <bazkie> any active reason or more of a trauma thing?
2021-05-12T18:50:00  <daftykins> D: that sounds nasty

2021-05-12T18:51:26  <bazkie> daftykins: i will hire a workplace from june 1st from which i will start work on ballsy 2 :)
2021-05-12T18:51:34  <daftykins> :O no wai
2021-05-12T18:51:39  <daftykins> does it cost much to do that?
2021-05-12T18:51:49  <bazkie> not that much, 115 euro a month
2021-05-12T18:52:07  <daftykins> is it one of those kinda open door shared places?
2021-05-12T18:52:12  <bazkie> that's for a desk in a room with ~10 other people
2021-05-12T18:52:14  <bazkie> yes
2021-05-12T18:52:21  <bazkie> i like it for the social aspect
2021-05-12T18:52:54  <daftykins> *nod* might be nice to have some interaction with others
2021-05-12T18:53:12  <daftykins> i've seen the door for one of those types of places here, looked to have some kinda swiped access though
2021-05-12T18:53:22  <bazkie> yeah and i noticed a lack of motivation when working here at home so it's time for a more defined workspace
2021-05-12T18:53:35  <bazkie> swiped? what does that mean

2021-05-12T18:54:24  <bazkie> ohh, right, i think i misudnerstood you. the place i'll hire is also not open in that sense
2021-05-12T18:54:43  <bazkie> as in it's open for visitors but you have to pay rent to hire a desk
2021-05-12T18:55:07  <bazkie> ah looks neat :)
2021-05-12T18:55:47  <daftykins> wow £50 per month for a hot desk
2021-05-12T18:55:47  <bazkie> i think what i'll get is similar to that 'allocated desk' thing. but way cheaper
2021-05-12T18:55:52  <bazkie> this place is very 'hip'
2021-05-12T18:55:55  <bazkie> the one you pasted 
2021-05-12T18:56:16  <bazkie> you think that's cheap or expensive?
2021-05-12T18:56:37  <daftykins> honestly i don't have a clue of the market but that seems good, especially as it says free use of office supplies
2021-05-12T18:56:46  <Lando-SpacePimp> daftykins, I saw
2021-05-12T18:56:46  <bazkie> yeah i think so too
2021-05-12T18:56:49  <daftykins> can totally imagine if i were ever forced to print something, it'd be neat to freeload
2021-05-12T18:56:50  <Lando-SpacePimp> I saw an article about like

2021-05-12T18:57:09  <Lando-SpacePimp> I saw an article about like a little cubicle at an airport that you pay money to use
2021-05-12T18:57:29  <bazkie> at an airport, that's an odd location, but maybe handy for like, businesspeople
2021-05-12T19:00:07  <daftykins> honestly though, hamstringing oneself on a laptop when i use triple displays at home... tough call
2021-05-12T19:00:31  <bazkie> uhhuh!! i feel that
2021-05-12T19:00:47  <bazkie> that's why i want an own desk. i just bought new monitor + gpu to create a proper second computer with 2 monitors at least
2021-05-12T19:00:47  <daftykins> but yeah the social benefits seem nice, this one speaks of events and so on
2021-05-12T19:01:26  <bazkie> allocated desk would be too expensive for you? what kind of work did you do again?
2021-05-12T19:01:48  <daftykins> freelance small biz and rich person support mostly
2021-05-12T19:02:28  <daftykins> often i have to go on-site but a couple of days a week to do boring admin-y stuff could work
2021-05-12T19:02:38  <bazkie> hehe
2021-05-12T19:02:47  <bazkie> boring admin-y stuff :D
2021-05-12T19:03:07  <bazkie> i once had this deal where I shared 1 allocated place with a friend
2021-05-12T19:03:39  <bazkie> so the one with the most free agenda would take the days that the other was off
2021-05-12T19:03:52  <daftykins> it's only about 300m from my home this place xD
2021-05-12T19:04:02  <daftykins> ah har
2021-05-12T19:04:02  <bazkie> it was a good middle ground, cheap and still your own place
2021-05-12T19:04:07  <bazkie> oooh nice
2021-05-12T19:04:25  <bazkie> you're gonna hate me when i say how close mine is lol

2021-05-12T19:24:41  <Anastasius> milehigh-: You can't fight it. Going to bed wakes up the brain these days for some reason.

2021-05-14T14:09:39  <darkhal0> 10:21:41 <milehigh-> if you're getting a lawyer to have control over freenode i hope that lawyer explains to you what an insolent little shit you are and that you can't just assume supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you 
2021-05-14T14:09:42  <Anastasius> Gosh, if I got some controlling interest over freenode (I've donated no money but have donated plenty of time so that should count, right?) wait for the ban list.
2021-05-14T14:09:56  <Anastasius> I have a list.
2021-05-14T14:11:14  <milehigh-> i've donated millions of thoughts and prayers
2021-05-14T14:11:33  <milehigh-> that's more valuable than money 
2021-05-14T14:12:05  <Anastasius> Amen.
2021-05-14T14:12:09  <Anastasius> So say we all.
2021-05-14T14:12:28  <moomoo> I've donated millions of keystrokes
2021-05-14T14:12:37  <moomoo> 90% of which were correct

2021-05-14T15:00:04  <milehigh-> 11:08:58 <joepie91> what gives you the legitimacy that you claim to have to speak in any kind of official or organizational capacity?
2021-05-14T15:00:04  <milehigh-> 11:09:00 <wright> rasengan: if you donated millions then where is that reflected on the company's house filing history

2021-05-14T15:00:08  <milehigh-> 11:09:23 <brabo> rasengan: keep hiding things from the community
2021-05-14T15:00:08  <milehigh-> 11:09:28 <brabo> surely more trust will be had
2021-05-14T15:00:09  <milehigh-> 11:09:29 <milehigh-> i can take half of freenode for you guys 
2021-05-14T15:00:09  <milehigh-> 11:09:29 <joepie91> rasengan: so that means there's no document. got it.

2021-05-14T15:15:11  <Anastasius> First of all, who'd want to own freenode anyway? This place sucks.
2021-05-14T15:15:29  <Anastasius> Secondly, I wouldn't marry that guy even if he was Jed Clampett.
2021-05-14T15:16:31  <milehigh-> lol
2021-05-14T15:16:53  <milehigh-> see i'd be all spiteful and give freenode to cholby or something
2021-05-14T15:19:27  <Anastasius> Now that would be a plan. Or better yet, that one aspie dude who's name I'm forgetting now. DYK.

2021-05-14T15:19:31  <Anastasius> That was it.

2021-05-14T15:20:44  <Anastasius> Let's start an investment.
2021-05-14T15:20:52  <Anastasius> Make it happen.

2021-05-14T15:43:25  <milehigh-> he stopped breathing, there was a lot of fluid in his lungs :/
2021-05-14T15:43:45  <milehigh-> we were all around to give him lovies though 
2021-05-14T15:44:40  <milehigh-> the move was too stressful to him

2021-05-15T15:40:59  <Anastasius> Or at least I think it was a double album.

2021-05-16T10:03:40  <darkhal0> can dogs eat olives/ 
2021-05-16T10:03:46  <darkhal0> olives on a pizza
2021-05-16T10:05:23  <darkhal0> Dogs can eat olives in moderation. They contain many vitamins and minerals important for human health, though dogs fed a complete and balanced diet don't need these additional nutrients. However, plain, unsalted olives can be a healthy snack for your pup. ... Olive pits may cause choking or obstructions in dogs.Jun 1, 2018
2021-05-16T10:05:35  <darkhal0>  cool

2021-05-16T14:35:32  <Anastasius> Truth.
2021-05-16T14:36:15  <Anastasius> That's a skill I wish I'd managed to pick up along the way.
2021-05-16T14:39:29  <Lando-SpacePimp> Anastasius, is Sliders any good?
2021-05-16T14:39:43  <Anastasius> Lando-SpacePimp: Only up to a certain point.
2021-05-16T14:40:59  <daftykins> neat premise that no doubt lost its' way, used to enjoy seeing some on TV as a kid
2021-05-16T14:41:01  <Anastasius> I caught a bit of it on Comet awhile back, and anything past the first few seasons is pretty bleh.
2021-05-16T14:43:29  <Anastasius> Slid downhill (see what I did there?) after they killed off Pavarotti.
2021-05-16T14:44:43  <Anastasius> I think in the final season they even recast Jerry O'Connell or... something.

2021-05-16T14:57:24  <Anastasius> I don't think they've changed their motif or menu since 1988.

2021-05-16T14:58:15  <Anastasius> Bad food, orange short shorts and boobs.

2021-05-16T15:00:09  <Anastasius> It's been an extremely long time since I set foot in one.
2021-05-16T15:01:09  <kevinf311-lap> we were in one location and then were going to be moving to another for the rest of the course and this was the last night we were in the first location

2021-05-16T15:11:09  <kevinf311-lap> cool, i'll check them out Lando-SpacePimp thanks
2021-05-16T15:11:27  <Anastasius> 9 hour drive with a few stops, one way, and I ended up driving the entire thing because the two friends I was with were too stoned to do much of anything.
2021-05-16T15:11:37  <kevinf311-lap> oof
2021-05-16T15:12:24  <Anastasius> Spent an hour in a grocery store before even leaving town looking for roadtrip snacks. Came out with some polish sausage, sunflower seeds and a large jar of pickles. o_O
2021-05-16T15:13:05  <kevinf311-lap> i need some more pickles 
2021-05-16T15:13:08  <Anastasius> Got into Denver around 4am, ate at a Village Inn, went out to Red Rocks (which was probably entirely illegal.
2021-05-16T15:13:11  * kevinf311-lap adds that to the grocer list
2021-05-16T15:13:13  <Anastasius> )
2021-05-16T15:13:53  <Anastasius> Completely like zero sleep for 3 days.
2021-05-16T15:14:51  <Anastasius> Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Left Thursday night, drove back Sunday night.
2021-05-16T15:15:39  <kevinf311-lap> glad you made it back! :D
2021-05-16T15:16:01  <Anastasius> It was a chore because it started snowing when we left Denver as well.

2021-05-17T13:12:41  <jip> hi
2021-05-17T13:12:52  <hoglahoo> hi
2021-05-17T13:24:57  <Shadow404> 2.89 here
2021-05-17T13:25:30  <Shadow404> bad time to drive my turbo
2021-05-17T13:25:44  <jip> :)
2021-05-17T13:25:48  <Shadow404> was as high as 3.29 at one point
2021-05-17T13:26:24  <hoglahoo> gas buddy claims there are stations where its 2.50 but I'd probably have to drive half an hour to find them
2021-05-17T13:32:44  <netdaemon> i always find it a little funny how some folk will drive a few miles out of the way to save a few cents on gas
2021-05-17T13:33:45  <hoglahoo> now see what I do is drive the usual distance I would normally, then park the car and get out and walk with several 5-gallon cans.  They won't be scamming me, no sir
2021-05-17T13:34:02  <netdaemon> hah
2021-05-17T13:34:10  <hoglahoo> or take an uber, I've done that too
2021-05-17T13:34:15  <hoglahoo> that way it's someone else paying for the gas
2021-05-17T13:34:17  <netdaemon> just burning more gas to get cheaper gas makes 0 sense
2021-05-17T13:34:56  <netdaemon> say you save 5 cents per gallon, that's only saving about 50c if you fill up 10 gallons if i mathed right
2021-05-17T13:38:47  <jip> Some people around here drive to Belgium for fuel. Because the taxes on them here are higher.
2021-05-17T13:40:58  <hoglahoo> irs allows something like 60 cents per mile on vehicle expenses: gas, wear and tear, etc.  So if I saved 50c, I hope it was less than half a mile each way out of my way, not including the extra time out of my life I spent chasing a few pennies and the extra risk of having a wreck for being on the road longer than I could have been
2021-05-17T13:41:26  <hoglahoo> ^ this is hoglahoo brain on pandemic lol
2021-05-17T13:44:22  <jip> hi hoglahoo's brain
2021-05-17T13:47:45  <netdaemon> hoglahoo: pretty much, lol
2021-05-17T13:48:08  <netdaemon> just pay the few extra cents per gallon and save that time
2021-05-17T13:48:20  <jip> 63% of the fuel price here is tax
2021-05-17T13:49:03  <netdaemon> i'm not sure what the ratio is here
2021-05-17T13:50:13  <netdaemon> ~50 cents per gallon
2021-05-17T13:51:51  <moomoo> FILL UP BAGS
2021-05-17T13:52:09  <jip> one gallon is $8,68 here now
2021-05-17T13:52:23  <netdaemon> here it's $3.09/gallon
2021-05-17T13:53:19  <moomoo> 89 CENTS PER BAG
2021-05-17T13:53:41  <netdaemon> so about 16% of it is taxes
2021-05-17T13:55:14  <jip> This is why we made our country so small and used up our space more efficiently: Fluel prices
2021-05-17T13:55:51  <netdaemon> yeah, and the US is spread out. unless you live in one of the population centers you pretty much need a car

2021-05-17T16:27:37  <jeans> Permanently closing the viaduct in Denver
2021-05-17T16:28:09  <Anastasius> How's that gonna work?
2021-05-17T16:28:41  <jeans> They are totally closing the highway Frida night, and when it reopens it'll be on the lowered section they just built
2021-05-17T16:29:11  <Anastasius> Oh I didn't realize they were doing reconstruction.
2021-05-17T16:29:22  <Anastasius> That area has always been a little dodgy.
2021-05-17T16:29:36  <jeans> Yeah and the viaduct is literally falling apart

2021-05-17T16:34:18  <Anastasius> breaking that shit free is always a pain in the ass.
2021-05-17T16:34:31  <jeans> And getting it back up too
2021-05-17T16:34:56  <Anastasius> Are those basically straight pipes?
2021-05-17T16:35:10  <jeans> There's glasspacks in the middle
2021-05-17T16:35:15  <Anastasius> Didn't seem to be much in the way of catalytics or mufflers.
2021-05-17T16:35:18  <Anastasius> Ah right.

2021-05-17T16:35:34  <jeans> No cats tho (never had them)
2021-05-17T16:35:53  <Anastasius> Huh, that's odd for 1976 isn't it?
2021-05-17T16:36:02  <jeans> Nup
2021-05-17T16:36:47  <Anastasius> Thought they started being required in the US around '73 or '74
2021-05-17T16:36:58  <Anastasius> Maybe not for imports yet though.
2021-05-17T16:37:05  <jeans> Iirc they weren't required until '94
2021-05-17T16:37:23  <Anastasius> Pretty sure that's wrong. :D
2021-05-17T16:37:23  <jeans> But it was increasingly hard to pass smog tests without them
2021-05-17T16:43:54  <Anastasius> At any rate, people are stealing them left right and sideways around here lately.
2021-05-17T16:53:03  <jeans> Anastasius: they were effectively "required" by the 1975 model year in order to meet emissions deadlines set out in 1970. And there are laws that prohibit removing a cat for any purpose other than to replace it with another one. However, I can't find any laws mandating just the presence of a converter until CA in 2009
2021-05-17T16:53:26  <Anastasius> Hmmm.
2021-05-17T16:53:39  <jeans> Realistically almost no cars could pass federal emissions regulations without them, so they were effectively universal 
2021-05-17T16:54:03  <Anastasius> Yeah that makes sense I guess.
2021-05-17T16:57:05  <jeans> And the EPA makes it illegal to remove any cat from any car for purposes other than replacement
2021-05-17T16:57:35  <jeans> So if your car had one new, it is required to be present. If not, you don't need one
2021-05-17T16:57:53  <jeans> My door assembly plaque states 'non-catalyst"
2021-05-17T16:58:32  <Anastasius> That's interesting, I didn't know they were exempt for awhile.
2021-05-17T16:58:48  <jeans> Everyone says they were required in 1975, but then how do I have a '76 without one?
2021-05-17T16:59:28  <m00se> t.ly/WXG5
2021-05-17T16:59:30  <Anastasius> There must have been some loopholes during the transition period.

2021-05-17T17:08:28  <jeans> Anastasius: clearly not a requirement, at least in 1976: https://i.imgur.com/QMLHKgZ.jpg
2021-05-17T17:10:52  <Anastasius> m00se: o_O
2021-05-17T17:15:20  <hoglahoo> dont they make next year's cars this year?  <jeans> Everyone says they were required in 1975, but then how do I have a '76 without one?
2021-05-17T17:15:27  <Anastasius> jeans: I'm guessing imports got some leeway, but I'm pretty sure everything American made 1975+ was required to have them, plus other emission control stuff that was dodgy.
2021-05-17T17:16:30  <jeans> hoglahoo: yes, but my car was made in 75 as a 76 model year, whereas everyone is saying that they were required in 74 for the 75 model year
2021-05-17T17:18:10  <hoglahoo> oh, I see
2021-05-17T17:18:34  <hoglahoo> In that case, I suspect there must have been some loopholes during the transition period. ;D
2021-05-17T17:18:46  <Anastasius> :D
2021-05-17T17:20:02  <Anastasius> I've seen some exhaust shops that are having offers to weld rebar around catalytic converters to make them next to impossible to steal quickly.
2021-05-17T17:20:10  <Anastasius> So there's a million dollar idea.
2021-05-17T17:20:18  <hoglahoo> not bad
2021-05-17T17:23:40  <m00se> just build a garage around it!

2021-05-18T22:58:28  <kevinf311-lap> but anyway, even though the characters are "the same" in Stargate the movie, it's "O'Neil" and in SG-1 it's "O'Neill" due to some not in-universe, legal blah blah whatever reason 
2021-05-18T22:58:45  <jeans> Orly
2021-05-18T22:58:58  <kevinf311-lap> and O'Neill has a line in one of the episodes where they he makes fun of that in a sorta 4th wall way

2021-05-18T23:09:55  <milehigh-> i mean do they have a little more clearance under? 
2021-05-18T23:10:00  <jeans> Also they sound more like a fart than my car without its exhaust
2021-05-18T23:10:10  <milehigh-> lol
2021-05-18T23:10:27  <jeans> Just lift it! =D
2021-05-18T23:10:45  <milehigh-> sure let me have the time and money to do it
2021-05-18T23:10:47  <milehigh-> NOT
2021-05-18T23:10:52  <milehigh-> lol
2021-05-18T23:11:12  <milehigh-> i need one that can climb my hill and has a little clearance

2021-05-18T23:11:57  <jeans> 💣
2021-05-18T23:12:00  <milehigh-> also we bottomed out the moving van on my hill so i can have bottomouts
2021-05-18T23:12:07  <milehigh-> lmaoooo
2021-05-18T23:12:12  <milehigh-> IT GOT STUCK
2021-05-18T23:12:18  <milehigh-> 26' truck 
2021-05-18T23:12:30  <jeans> 💣
2021-05-18T23:12:33  <jeans> I'm telling you
2021-05-18T23:12:44  <milehigh-> can you not 
2021-05-18T23:13:00  <milehigh-> no doing things to my house 
2021-05-18T23:13:08  <jeans> No not your house
2021-05-18T23:13:09  <milehigh->  >____>
2021-05-18T23:13:13  <jeans> The driveway
2021-05-18T23:13:24  <milehigh-> thats not how it would work
2021-05-18T23:14:07  <jeans> You just need the correct 💣! (ᐛ)
2021-05-18T23:14:16  <milehigh-> it would cost less money to just get an AWD car
2021-05-18T23:15:09  <jeans> WRXs are AWD!
2021-05-18T23:15:25  <milehigh-> Clearance.
2021-05-18T23:15:34  <milehigh-> i liked the outback
2021-05-18T23:15:57  <milehigh-> There's a few i was looking at. 
2021-05-18T23:16:37  <milehigh-> if the WRX's weren't so close to the ground I would love to get one. 
2021-05-18T23:16:48  <milehigh-> it will bottom out guaranteed. 
2021-05-18T23:16:53  <jeans> Spedy
2021-05-18T23:17:24  <milehigh-> the highest speed limit in my city is 40mph. Speedy is not a thing here.
2021-05-18T23:18:19  <jeans> As if the speed limit is as fast as you can go. ;D
2021-05-18T23:18:49  <milehigh-> Please keep trying to get me to buy a car you want instead of a car i need lol. >.>
2021-05-18T23:19:20  <jeans> Tbf I don't want a WRX
2021-05-18T23:19:31  <jeans> I don't vape enough
2021-05-18T23:19:36  <jeans> >_>
2021-05-18T23:20:28  <milehigh-> neither do i
2021-05-18T23:20:47  * jeans sends milehigh- a big giant vape pen
2021-05-18T23:21:04  <milehigh-> I wonder if another forester would be ok just a newer model or if they are all head gasket killers
2021-05-18T23:21:28  <jeans> Tbh I'm surprised yours didn't like the head gasket
2021-05-18T23:21:28  <milehigh-> vaping makes me sneeze.
2021-05-18T23:21:48  <jeans> Also if you get a new head gasket, your current one is probably gonna be just fine
2021-05-18T23:21:55  <milehigh-> eh 
2021-05-18T23:22:07  <milehigh-> they have to do more than that
2021-05-18T23:22:12  <milehigh-> its not worth fixing
2021-05-18T23:22:24  <milehigh-> radiator and hoses need replacing as well. 
2021-05-18T23:23:30  <jeans> That can't be too bad
2021-05-18T23:23:35  <milehigh-> $3k
2021-05-18T23:23:45  <jeans> For the radiator‽
2021-05-18T23:23:51  <milehigh-> everything
2021-05-18T23:24:02  <milehigh-> need to flush it all too
2021-05-18T23:24:04  <milehigh-> etc
2021-05-18T23:24:08  <jeans> Oh that's not bad
2021-05-18T23:24:29  <milehigh-> i'm not paying that
2021-05-18T23:25:02  <jeans> I mean, it sounds to me like the radiator is the real problem, which took the head gasket out with our
2021-05-18T23:25:06  <jeans> *with you
2021-05-18T23:25:35  <milehigh-> if i'm going to spend $3k i 'm going to trade it in for the $8k it's worth (offer confirmed), and put $3k down on a newer car.
2021-05-18T23:25:46  <milehigh-> and then have a better car 
2021-05-18T23:26:31  <milehigh-> without issues and itwill be in warranty, which this other caris not
2021-05-18T23:27:30  <milehigh-> hoglahoo: gets me
2021-05-18T23:27:46  <jeans> I suppose. I just replaced my head gasket myself lol
2021-05-18T23:28:05  <milehigh-> you have to remove the engine for tthese ones
2021-05-18T23:28:13  <jeans> Eww
2021-05-18T23:28:13  * milehigh- doesn't have the time or tools 
2021-05-18T23:28:35  <milehigh-> and now i've learned why subarus are a bitch to fix
2021-05-18T23:28:38  <milehigh-> the older ones at elast.
2021-05-18T23:28:46  <milehigh-> apparently they fixed this issue
2021-05-18T23:28:53  <milehigh-> supposedly.
2021-05-18T23:28:56  <jeans> Also worth pointing out that pretty much all Subarus have the same engine
2021-05-18T23:29:07  <milehigh-> this one is a boxer engine
2021-05-18T23:29:17  <jeans> Yup, like literally all is them
2021-05-18T23:29:22  <jeans> *of them
2021-05-18T23:30:10  <milehigh-> huh i just looked and didnt know that all of them are 
2021-05-18T23:30:20  <milehigh-> thought only some of them were
2021-05-18T23:30:37  <jeans> No, they all are
2021-05-18T23:30:41  <milehigh-> https://www.iangrieve.co.uk/news/do-all-subaru-cars-have-a-boxer-engine/22243/newsdetail.aspx#:~:text=Yes%2C%20Subaru%20is%20the%20only,%2C%20Legacy%2C%20and%20BRZ%20models.
2021-05-18T23:30:43  <ubnot2> Title: Do all Subaru Cars Have a Boxer Engine? | Ian Grieve | Falkirk | Ian Grieve (at www.iangrieve.co.uk)
2021-05-18T23:30:50  <jeans> I don't even think they have the flat-6 anymore
2021-05-18T23:30:59  <milehigh-> idk 
2021-05-18T23:31:03  <jeans> Some of the really old ones are inline-4
2021-05-18T23:31:07  <milehigh-> i really do like how they handle though 
2021-05-18T23:31:12  <jeans> Or even inline-3s
2021-05-18T23:31:15  <milehigh-> much better than my hondas
2021-05-18T23:31:34  <milehigh-> not sure!
2021-05-18T23:31:43  <milehigh-> they have been neat to learn about
2021-05-18T23:33:06  <jeans> milehigh-: https://i.imgur.com/OGPychH.jpg
2021-05-18T23:34:15  <milehigh-> yeah dont think those are a thing anymore 
2021-05-19T00:17:19  <m00se> jesus h jeans is that your engine?
2021-05-19T00:17:34  <jeans> Yes
2021-05-19T00:17:43  <jeans> Not presently obvs
2021-05-19T00:18:08  <m00se> I'm gonna go ahead and guess all that carbon and goo was from you starting it back when you first found it
2021-05-19T00:18:22  <m00se> that's a textbook shitty engine top end right there
2021-05-19T00:18:36  <jeans> There's no top end at all
2021-05-19T00:19:01  <jeans> All of the black is the head gasket
2021-05-19T00:19:42  <m00se> top of the pistons, top of the deck, exhaust etc
2021-05-19T00:19:47  <m00se> mess
2021-05-19T00:19:58  <jeans> You can't even see the deck. =þ
2021-05-19T00:20:18  <m00se> you can see what there is of it around the god damned gasket foo
2021-05-19T00:20:51  <m00se> you ever see what a "normal" heads off block looks like? It ain't that
2021-05-19T00:20:55  <jeans> No, the gasket covers literally all of the deck in that shot
2021-05-19T00:21:26  <m00se> not here to argue semantics
2021-05-19T00:21:47  <jeans> Wow I didn't know you were there when I did my head gasket
2021-05-19T00:22:16  <m00se> looks pretty cooked to me!
2021-05-19T00:22:41  <m00se> did you have it machined or just new one
2021-05-19T00:23:12  <jeans> It was pretty flat so I just cleaned the deck and put the head on
2021-05-19T00:23:13  <m00se> new gasket I meant
2021-05-19T00:23:21  <jeans> New gasket, yes
2021-05-19T00:23:33  <m00se> course...I meant have the deck machined
2021-05-19T00:23:38  <m00se> run any better now?
2021-05-19T00:23:45  <jeans> Yep, runs great
2021-05-19T00:24:22  <m00se> man that's some serious carbon tho lol
2021-05-19T00:24:49  <jeans> Nah, it was barely built up. Didn't stick up above the gasket
2021-05-19T00:25:10  <m00se> "wat's your compression ratio" "before or after I cleaned the pistons?"
2021-05-19T00:25:58  <m00se> what did your spark plugs look like?
2021-05-19T00:25:59  <jeans> Didn't clean them because I couldn't rotate the engine without dropping the timing chain, and I didn't want to scratch the cylinder walls
2021-05-19T00:26:13  <jeans> They were fine, slightly white
2021-05-19T00:26:40  <jeans> Given the leaky intake manifolds, that wasn't unexpected
2021-05-19T00:27:39  <m00se> so what's the strategy just leave that carbon on there or are you going to use seafoam or the like?
2021-05-19T00:28:16  <jeans> The carbon isn't hurting anything. I cleaned off the valves and the insides of the combustion chamber
2021-05-19T00:29:33  <jeans> A lot more likely to knock some carbon down by the ring lands and cause way more damage that way
2021-05-19T00:29:48  <m00se> she go through the oil does she?
2021-05-19T00:29:59  <jeans> It did, yeah
2021-05-19T00:30:15  <jeans> Leaky, hard valve stem seals
2021-05-19T00:30:51  <m00se> by the looks of those cylinder walls...it might stop leaking down those valve stems and start bypassing the oil rings next
2021-05-19T00:31:12  <m00se> or was already both
2021-05-19T00:31:36  <m00se> saving for a total rebuild eventually?
2021-05-19T00:32:09  <jeans> The cylinder walls (what I could see) looked great. Still had crosshatch from the original assembly and it makes excellent compression
2021-05-19T00:32:21  <jeans> I'm not planning on a rebuild
2021-05-19T00:32:50  <m00se> picture doesn't convey that
2021-05-19T00:33:15  <jeans> Nope, it doesn't
2021-05-19T00:33:31  <jeans> The picture is not a diagnostic tool. =þ
2021-05-19T00:35:11  <m00se> telling enough
2021-05-19T00:35:56  <jeans> It's a terrible cell phone photo with bad lighting. It tells nothing other than the head was off the car

2021-05-19T07:46:53  <daftykins> i'm in pain today gang, i'm having to buy a crApple product for a client... it makes me so sad
2021-05-19T07:48:46  <netdaemon> it's a DDOS allegedly
2021-05-19T07:49:12  <jip> is it?
2021-05-19T07:49:38  <daftykins> LOL
2021-05-19T07:49:46  <daftykins> yeah from freenode users connecting xD
2021-05-19T07:49:49  <netdaemon> i guess there's a discussion in ##freenode-staff about it
2021-05-19T07:50:17  <netdaemon> [08:44] <l0de> lts: I believe it is a distributed denial of service attack in china
2021-05-19T07:50:46  <jip> but what do you believe?
2021-05-19T07:51:04  <hoglahoo> is netdaemon a man of faith?
2021-05-19T07:51:15  <netdaemon> i mean, it's entirely plausible. and no i'm not a man of faith
2021-05-19T07:51:33  <netdaemon> there's a vested interest in preventing a mass exodus, lol
2021-05-19T07:51:35  <jip> then where do the deamons come from?
2021-05-19T07:51:45  <netdaemon> people with neckbeards

2021-05-19T11:01:21  <daftykins> libera seems to have growing pains right now so i'd imagine the dust should settle before a decision is made
2021-05-19T11:03:12  <netdaemon> it seems to have stabilized for the moment
2021-05-19T11:16:14  <netdaemon> i'v not been d/c'd in a while at least

2021-05-19T12:24:46  <moomoo> why do people do bad things that result in me having to exert effort :(
2021-05-19T12:25:01  <moomoo> truly I am the victim here
2021-05-19T12:25:17  <hoglahoo> life is cruel, treat you unfairly

2021-05-19T12:52:35  <netdaemon> i prolly won't join the other side until whoever registers and takes ownership of it
2021-05-19T12:52:46  <netdaemon> easier if it's just one person in there
