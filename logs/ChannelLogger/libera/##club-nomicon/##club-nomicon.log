2021-05-19T16:16:17  <gav> If someone took advantage of her, she should have said so instead of deleting everything. The lack of comments looks shady
2021-05-19T16:23:43  <daftykins> best i saw explained, they said she sold it in order to get some event going... makes very little sense that brief
2021-05-19T16:24:25  <gav> Well, they sold the holding company, but it's unclear to what extent the holding company actually owned the network, and it's likely it never actually did
2021-05-19T16:27:30  <gav> My understanding is that the holding company was established in order that there be a legal entity for setting up the live conferences, and while it owned the domain names and the website, it didn't actually own any of the network itself (because the infrastructure was donated)

2021-05-19T19:54:45  <Spec> is there new data on them navy vidyas?

2021-05-20T08:16:53  <Tamara> hi h80k/!!!!
2021-05-20T08:18:56  <pteague> i'm trying to get work done & manager drops a game bot in our main channel that just spams questions
2021-05-20T08:25:25  <kn100> #freenode over on freenode is absolute chaos
2021-05-20T08:25:37  <kn100> Oh man there isn't enough popcorn in the world
2021-05-20T08:26:51  * daftykins takes a look
2021-05-20T08:28:09  * h00k grabs popcorn
2021-05-20T08:28:19  <h00k> I wonder if I should del my registration/nick there
2021-05-20T08:30:16  <daftykins> i'm still holding out for a bit and have 2 IRC clients up at once xD
2021-05-20T08:31:13  <kn100> Yeah I can be in both, not like it costs anything 
2021-05-20T08:31:41  <h00k> just YOUR FREEDOM
2021-05-20T08:31:42  <h00k> just kidding
2021-05-20T08:31:48  <h00k> at most, your nickserv password?
2021-05-20T08:32:06  <kn100> Not like it's used for anything else, they can have it lol
2021-05-20T08:32:25  <kn100> I will probably kill off the freenode connx in a few days time 
2021-05-20T08:32:25  <m0nk> then I will become kn100
2021-05-20T08:32:29  <daftykins> my thoughts exactly
2021-05-20T08:32:36  <m0nk> and leg humpings will commence! 
2021-05-20T08:32:41  <daftykins> m0nk: hey babeh where've you been!? 
2021-05-20T08:32:55  <m0nk> daftykins: send tits bb
2021-05-20T08:32:55  <kn100> m0nk, only I own kn100.me, the home of kn100(tm)
2021-05-20T08:33:05  <kn100> You can't have it 
2021-05-20T08:33:23  <m0nk> daftykins: pretty good finished my move andnow I just have to re build my man hole
2021-05-20T08:33:28  <kn100> And leg humping should be avoided if at all possible
2021-05-20T08:33:37  <kn100> Move far?
2021-05-20T08:33:49  <m0nk> kn100: nah like 1 mile
2021-05-20T08:34:31  <kn100> This flat I'm living in now has a lot of random smart home gear now (all cloudless of course) and I am dreading moving since setting it all up again is going to be a pain
2021-05-20T08:34:33  <daftykins> m0nk: oh shit you moved my kids? can i have the new address? ;)
2021-05-20T08:34:54  <m0nk> daftykins: well send,  mrs m0nk has been lonely as well
2021-05-20T08:35:17  <m0nk> kn100: lol I made this house smart
2021-05-20T08:35:26  <m0nk> every light is a smart light (hue / smart switch)
2021-05-20T08:35:48  <m0nk> and I dropped a homepod in nearly every room
2021-05-20T08:35:54  <kn100> it's good fun but I absolutely will not sign up to anything to make it work! 
2021-05-20T08:36:10  <m0nk> kn100: yeah homekit has been a requirement
2021-05-20T08:36:23  <m0nk> I just have to replace the Nest thermostats and get a doorbell
2021-05-20T08:36:44  <kn100> Self hosted for the win - even my vacuum cleaner runs custom firmware so it doesn't send the around 15gb of who knows what data a month to some server in China anymore
2021-05-20T08:37:20  <m0nk> I am not sure how much information is sent out but I  know all of my devices will work without internet connection
2021-05-20T08:37:48  <kn100> Yeah the Philips stuff I might trust 
2021-05-20T08:37:58  <kn100> But all of my stuff is cheap and or Chinese :p
2021-05-20T08:38:37  <kn100> Even my wifi plugs came from the local poundland (they cost 7 pounds, but 7 pounds for a hackable wifi plug is insane right?!)
2021-05-20T08:38:45  <m0nk> that is 
2021-05-20T08:38:58  <m0nk> I would be inclined to buy it just to play with (not even neccesarily to use)
2021-05-20T08:39:13  <kn100> That was my plan too
2021-05-20T08:39:25  <m0nk> but yeah I went expensive
2021-05-20T08:39:29  <kn100> I just had to know what it was like for that cheap, and the answer is really nice actually! 
2021-05-20T08:39:38  <daftykins> what do you mean, is it a powerline adapter or just a crappy wifi extender?
2021-05-20T08:39:42  <m0nk> I was replacing a lot of canlighting with Hue RGB lights so... no need to save money!
2021-05-20T08:39:49  <kn100> Eap8285 based chipset, decent chunky relay, excellent build quality, etc 
2021-05-20T08:39:51  <m0nk> kn100: is it fast?
2021-05-20T08:40:03  <m0nk> kn100: my biggest compliant with a majority of wifi plugs is they are SLOW 
2021-05-20T08:40:25  <kn100> daftykins m0nk - it's a wifi power plug, as in it passes power through and you can switch it off and on remotely
2021-05-20T08:40:41  <kn100> That's all it does, essentially a wifi controlled relay
2021-05-20T08:40:47  <daftykins> oh i get you
2021-05-20T08:41:03  <m0nk> my OG m0nk hole had one of those
2021-05-20T08:41:20  <m0nk> it used a laptop parallel port to control the relay though (not a tiny micro controller)
2021-05-20T08:41:26  <m0nk> that was built back when men were men!
2021-05-20T08:44:50  <daftykins> xD
2021-05-20T08:45:06  <kn100> https://kn100.me/declouding-chinese-wifi-plugs/ these things (another shameless blog plug :p) -- amazing how much you can get for 7 pounds 
2021-05-20T08:45:12  <ubnot2> Title: Declouding Chinese WIFi plugs (at kn100.me)
2021-05-20T08:46:02  <daftykins> i just picked up one of those Wyze cameras and modded it, unfortunately i tried doing the bootloader step and can't work out what's going on now
2021-05-20T08:46:30  <daftykins> i need to buy one of those little 3 pin header pieces so i can connect to the serial header on the little guy (hopefully) and watch for what happens
2021-05-20T08:46:50  <kn100> Just solder wires to it! Be a maaaan
2021-05-20T08:47:36  <daftykins> well, my TTL gadget still has bare pins to connect to - so i'd still need a header
2021-05-20T08:47:59  <daftykins> erm not pins but a header
2021-05-20T08:48:49  <daftykins> i suppose i could shove bare wire ends in, if i used a length of cat6 i have loose
2021-05-20T08:49:24  <kn100> Depends how desperately you want to do it I guess!
2021-05-20T08:49:47  <daftykins> well it is the cat's birthday on Sunday - i was livestreaming her on twitch when i first got the camera going xD
2021-05-20T08:50:10  <m0nk> lol
2021-05-20T08:50:22  <m0nk> oh Tuya
2021-05-20T08:50:41  <m0nk> btw,  kn100 its not just cheap chinese items that use Tuya apparently Bazz devices do too
2021-05-20T08:51:19  <h00k> Tuya, I'm hit/miss on those
2021-05-20T08:51:41  <h00k> before solderless/clipless firmware on some bulbs, great... but I don't think that's a thing on my bulbs anymore
2021-05-20T08:52:04  <m0nk> I dont like that method at all
2021-05-20T08:52:20  <m0nk> out of the box the device is crippled and tied (un neccesarily) to a cloud server
2021-05-20T08:52:39  <m0nk> I wish the super cheap end for it all had been Zwave or something similar 
2021-05-20T08:52:53  <m0nk> but I suppose Zwave radios are more expensive than cheap MCUs with built in wifi
2021-05-20T08:56:29  <h00k> some of them could be flashed because of a vulnerability without wires, which is neato.
2021-05-20T08:56:36  <h00k> then they fixed it, no more magic packets.
2021-05-20T09:00:25  <daftykins> the little camera i got needed a little bit more digging to find a slightly newer edition of an image to pop onto a microSD card which the device then flashed itself with upon holding down a button
2021-05-20T09:00:50  <daftykins> after that they had a set of files to toss on the card which it then booted from :D
2021-05-20T09:15:45  <h00k> Neato
2021-05-20T09:19:20  <daftykins> things got weird when i SSH'd in and flashed the alternative bootloader though, which is meant to help enable full HD video by reallocating memory assignments at boot time... doesn't seem to be responding although the lights match what they said

2021-05-20T12:53:01  <h00k> I should give it an actual listen
2021-05-20T13:09:04  <kn100> h00k yeah I didn't have any luck with the magic packet malarchy on these wifi plugs, they were patched. No bother though just cut an ugly hole in a 230v mains appliance and solder directly to the ESP8285 inside!
2021-05-20T13:09:31  <kn100> Sadly they seem to be moving away from the esp8285 to some closed down realtek thing

2021-05-20T15:39:08  <m0nk> :D
2021-05-20T15:39:33  <m0nk> speaking of that, the whole opensource world has lost its fucking mind, RMS is back and now freenode is all fucked 
2021-05-20T15:39:37  <m0nk> I think its a conspiracy
2021-05-20T15:39:43  <m0nk> Q must know whats going on
2021-05-20T15:41:22  <Tamara> Q
2021-05-20T15:42:20  <Pieter> What's going on with RMS?
2021-05-20T15:45:06  <m0nk> putting him back as the leader of the FSF was a bad idea
2021-05-20T15:45:31  <m0nk> the way they did it also was kind of a "fuck you this is us and we do what we want"
2021-05-20T15:45:35  <m0nk> sort of the situation on freenode
2021-05-20T15:45:41  <m0nk> (at least how it seems a bit)
2021-05-20T15:49:18  <Pieter> Goodnight
2021-05-20T15:49:27  <m0nk> Pieter: sleep well man
2021-05-20T15:49:51  <Pieter> Thanks!
2021-05-20T15:50:05  <Pieter> Also, i didn't know RMS was back 😂
2021-05-20T15:50:15  <Pieter> Been busy with offline stuff for the last few months 
2021-05-20T15:50:19  <m0nk> yeah they kind of forced it in... its a pretty divisive subject
2021-05-20T15:50:33  <m0nk> I wasnt trying to start a war with anyone lol but I suppose you can see where I fall on it
2021-05-20T15:53:50  <m0nk> that said, should a man who eats his toe jam on stage...... really be leading ANYTHING?

2021-05-20T16:06:50  <Tamara> what's an ubuntu and how do i protect my family from it
2021-05-20T16:07:19  <m0nk> Tamara: you start by keeping South African biilionaires away from schools and children
2021-05-20T16:07:31  <Tamara> sounds like a good start yes
2021-05-20T16:10:08  <m0nk> thats it
2021-05-20T16:10:23  <m0nk> just keep that Shuttleworth fella away from kids and schools and we will be all good
2021-05-20T16:10:25  <Tamara> so that's the one step program for protecting my family huh
2021-05-20T16:11:23  <m0nk> indeed
2021-05-20T16:11:41  * ski waves to em
2021-05-20T16:11:45  <m0nk> if you dont do that then they will install ubuntu linux on your computers and turn your kids into satan worshipping communists
2021-05-20T16:12:06  <Tamara> oh maybe i have heard of ubuntu
2021-05-20T16:12:08  <Pieter> Communists have vodka
2021-05-20T16:12:11  <Pieter> Which I approve of
2021-05-20T16:12:12  <Tamara> didn't it fail some college kid her course?
2021-05-20T16:13:18  <m0nk> Tamara: of course, the commies dont want our children to be well educated!

2021-05-20T16:16:34  <Anastasius> One of the new ones?
2021-05-20T16:17:01  <m0nk> yeah I got the 11" 
2021-05-20T16:17:18  <m0nk> I've been using a regular one for my notes for the past year and a half and quite like it for that
2021-05-20T16:17:24  <m0nk> (and for reading and 3d modeling)
2021-05-20T16:17:30  <Anastasius> Sweet.
2021-05-20T16:17:38  <m0nk> so that new chip... made me pants not fit very well 
2021-05-20T16:17:49  <Anastasius> :D
2021-05-20T16:19:15  <Anastasius> They do look pretty nice, was just looking at the specs.
2021-05-20T16:20:39  <m0nk> I think Apple has made AMD and Intel irrelevant 
2021-05-20T16:21:26  <m0nk> seems like M1 is able to scale up and down in ways that X86 has never been capable of
2021-05-20T16:28:10  <m0nk> I am excited its going to be the best UX for doing useless shit that we've had other solutions for for... ever 
2021-05-20T16:36:24  <daftykins> nice chips, shame their software standards keep taking a nosedive
2021-05-20T16:42:27  <m0nk> daftykins: I cant really comment to much on that

2021-05-20T18:29:31  <LjL> this move has been shaking my nerves

2021-05-20T18:58:56  <yano> yeah, i haven't figured out the matrix bridge stuff either
2021-05-20T18:59:12  <yano> i just know they are still working on setting it up for Libera :-\
2021-05-20T19:00:42  <LjL> yano, it's already resulting in some channels moving to OFTC just because it already has a bridge
2021-05-20T19:01:02  <yano> oh yikes
2021-05-20T19:01:26  <LjL> well, or maybe for other reasons too, but sometimes people just reach for the lowest apple on the tree
2021-05-20T19:01:38  <LjL> or the next-lowest. the lowest is "staying on freenode"
2021-05-20T19:01:41  <LjL> until that apple rots

2021-05-20T19:03:55  <|_ocke> i'm a little confused why this all waited till now to happen, and didn't happen in 2017 when PIA/LTM got freenode
2021-05-20T19:05:22  <daftykins> i didn't like that move at all
2021-05-20T19:05:30  <witeshark2> |_ocke, i agree with that

2021-05-22T17:22:31  <LjL> <rasengan> Great question.  There shouldn't be any noticeable changes to most outside of, of course, the instances where channels actually may have moved to other networks in the interim.  In the future, however, there will be significant benefits to end users as we establish a more democratized governance.  The short answer, is that we're establishing more representation for users and groups across the network so that you all will have much more input.

2021-05-22T17:24:03  <LjL> Anastasius, there's drama, i'm like bees to honey
2021-05-22T17:24:14  <Anastasius> :D
2021-05-22T17:24:31  <waterytart> it's nice to see you back LjL :)
2021-05-22T17:25:46  <LjL> i have a small problem though
2021-05-22T17:25:53  <LjL> due to all this mess i've spent too much time at the keyboard
2021-05-22T17:26:07  <LjL> and i have some pretty terrible rsi, or carpal tunnel, or whatever it is flareup right now
2021-05-22T17:26:14  <Anastasius> Ow...
2021-05-22T17:26:54  <LjL> if only we had moved to whatsapp where i can send voice messages...
2021-05-22T17:27:00  <LjL> (i'm told)
2021-05-22T17:27:16  <LjL> although i don't understand the spoken word, so whatever
2021-05-22T17:29:22  <kn100> heh, if we're going Whatsapp let's just go Telegram - group chats in Telegram are actually fairly excellent
2021-05-22T17:29:30  <kn100> but IRC certainly has the cool factor
2021-05-22T17:30:35  <LjL> i'm not seriously suggesting whatsapp
2021-05-22T17:30:42  <LjL> i am on Matrix though, although i'm not fully sold
2021-05-22T17:31:34  <kn100> I hear MSN Messenger is pretty good
2021-05-22T17:32:10  <Anastasius> Be-deep
2021-05-22T17:32:24  <Anastasius> Bo-doop
2021-05-22T17:34:56  <em> I think maybe this is all happening because christal found some way to cash out and didn't bother to tell anyone 
2021-05-22T17:35:17  <LjL> i mean if Libera didn't currently lack a bridge with Matrix, i'd connect to Matrix and pester you with voice messages that get bridged to IRC in the form of /me's with links to .ogg files
2021-05-22T17:35:53  <kn100> I've never tried Matrix but I've recently gone big on self hosted stuff so maybe I should try hosting a node
2021-05-22T17:35:55  <Anastasius> I still don't like bridging.
2021-05-22T17:36:02  <LjL> Anastasius, it's honestly a mess
2021-05-22T17:36:18  <LjL> but sometimes it works
2021-05-22T17:36:58  <LjL> anyway, what i'm hearing is that they want to try to find a different arrangement on Libera that makes it less "problematic" (also from a privacy point of view, although i don't know what they have in mind there)
2021-05-22T17:37:09  <LjL> which means they'll take their time to figure out an arrangement with Matrix
2021-05-22T17:37:20  <LjL> which however isn't great for channels that *want* to migrate, but have a ton of people on the Matrix side
2021-05-22T17:37:44  <LjL> i think it's not something that should be negotiated now. just get a bridge running, talk about the details later
2021-05-22T17:37:55  <LjL> same as how they've changed policies about # vs ## channels subtly
2021-05-22T17:37:57  <LjL> now was not the time
2021-05-22T17:37:59  <LjL> just adds confusion
2021-05-22T17:44:19  <Anastasius> Too much confusion.
2021-05-22T17:45:14  <daftykins> Can't... get no relief.
2021-05-22T17:45:48  <LjL> but
2021-05-22T17:45:49  <LjL> for the record
2021-05-22T17:45:54  <LjL> italy won eurovision
2021-05-22T17:45:57  <LjL> and the UK got 0 points
2021-05-22T17:46:01  <LjL> both of which are proper things
2021-05-22T17:46:27  <Anastasius> lol, is that still a thing?

2021-05-22T17:46:39  <LjL> not really, i think moocow was ignoring it
2021-05-22T17:46:41  <LjL> so not really anymore
2021-05-22T17:46:58  <Anastasius> lol, nice

2021-05-22T18:03:18  <LjL> maybe i've heard something on reddit or whatever now that i think about it
2021-05-22T18:03:27  <LjL> what i know is that UFO reports in aeronautics are quite common
2021-05-22T18:03:46  <LjL> in most cases they should probably be taken literally, as flying objects that were not identified
2021-05-22T18:04:31  <Anastasius> I think they're just the mouse cursors of whoever's running the simulation.
2021-05-22T18:04:58  <LjL> heh
2021-05-22T18:05:02  <LjL> did you ask Musk?
2021-05-22T18:05:14  <LjL> and if you do, can you also tell him to write something good about bitcoins so that mine go up again?
2021-05-22T18:05:24  <Anastasius> LD
2021-05-22T18:05:30  <Anastasius> :D
2021-05-22T18:09:04  <LjL> Anastasius, what i think when i watch this footage is, if these aircraft can lock onto targets like that, welp, i wouldn't wanna be their target
2021-05-22T18:09:44  <Anastasius> LjL: Yeah, weapons hold.
2021-05-22T18:14:19  <CoJaBo> That recent one, the "Pyramid UFO", was fricking hilarious
2021-05-22T18:14:38  <CoJaBo> Someone posted a video showing how obviously it was a Boeing 737
2021-05-22T18:15:20  <Anastasius> Oh sure, probably something like 95% of these sightings are bullshit.
2021-05-22T18:16:03  <Anastasius> maybe it's because I've recently been reviewing the X-Files, but I want to believe.
2021-05-22T18:16:42  <CoJaBo> The pentagon or something confirmed it even........ how?
2021-05-22T18:16:52  <CoJaBo> like.. did they not watch the video rofl

2021-05-22T18:17:58  <daftykins> that's the sign
2021-05-22T18:18:20  <daftykins> i am curious when that time expires and the report should come out, though i'm sure it'll be useless

2021-05-22T18:32:09  <LjL> dunno what to think of this
2021-05-22T18:32:10  <LjL> <jess> staff weren't "the cabal" - it was 4 people
2021-05-22T18:32:10  <LjL> [...]
2021-05-22T18:32:10  <LjL> <CrystalMath> jess: tell me one thing (it may even sway my opinion), whose idea was it to destroy ##goodolddays? staff or the cabal?
2021-05-22T18:32:10  <LjL> <jess> we used to joke about librenode
2021-05-22T18:32:11  <LjL> <jess> CrystalMath: staff, cabal didn't like shutting down channels even when we needed to
2021-05-22T18:32:22  <LjL> i guess i would need to know what that channel was doing
2021-05-22T18:32:41  <LjL> but i guess overall it means new staff are going to be more aggressive about closing channels that aren't deemed on topic
2021-05-22T18:32:48  <LjL> which is kind of reflected in their current policy wording
2021-05-22T18:33:25  <LjL> "Informal channels are for topics not covered by our on-topic projects. As per our policies, such channels can exist on Libera.Chat as long as they do not disturb the operations of our network and our project and community channels"

2021-05-22T19:30:30  <em> LjL: i don't know what all of that means
2021-05-22T19:32:16  <LjL> em, me neither, really. just that there was one channel where people probably talked about some right-wing shit, among other things, and staff wanted it gone because they thought it violated policy, but the "cabal" (i.e. senior staff, which jess says was really just 4 people) were more restrained in closing channels
2021-05-22T19:32:40  <LjL> i think this might tangentially related to this channel, since it's also a sort of "free speech" channel where things that honestly don't really fit with freenode's policy sometimes fly around
2021-05-22T19:32:51  <LjL> or, well, libera's policy

2021-05-22T19:47:33  <Anastasius> It was a number of years ago he was over here (there) trying to stir shit up and I just told him to get lost.
2021-05-22T19:47:35  <Anastasius> He did.
2021-05-22T19:47:51  <Anastasius> Let's keep it that way.

2021-05-22T19:49:37  <LjL> which i actually just wrote him in an email after a brief exchange where i pointed out to him (as ubuntu irc council member) that Andrew Lee was likely misrepresenting Ubuntu's "sponsorship" of freenode

2021-05-22T19:49:58  <Anastasius> Interesting. He was always a big old meanie to me.

Taken from the Bible, Numbers 23:23, and recorded on a paper tape, the phrase had been suggested to Morse by Annie Ellsworth, the young daughter of a friend.

2021-05-23T13:51:06  <Anastasius> LjL: Well those were the days.
2021-05-23T13:51:23  <waterytart> we're still cooler tho :P
2021-05-23T13:51:43  <Anastasius> They could never win at Scrabble, either.
2021-05-23T13:51:55  <em> i think maybe that quote should be !faggot or something and not my name it's just one thing that I said
2021-05-23T13:52:00  <waterytart> haha
2021-05-23T13:52:36  <waterytart> i would rather not have !faggot as a factoid only because of the inferences ... 
2021-05-23T13:52:45  <waterytart> but maybe something else
2021-05-23T13:53:02  <waterytart> frankly that is an excellent and maybe my favorite quote of yours lol
2021-05-23T13:53:14  <em> :)
2021-05-23T13:53:34  <Anastasius> Yeah, emma needs to pick her own personal factoid. Change it to be !sticks or something. :)

2021-05-23T13:56:49  <waterytart> helps on long work days 
2021-05-23T13:57:03  <LjL> Anastasius: yes I'm a faggot and I lose at Scrabble and most things but guess what if you go back to the Prince's network you can call me a faggot without the channel risking being shut down if they don't chastize you for it, but here, that'll only be if they don't notice or care enough :p
2021-05-23T13:57:40  <waterytart> Are we sure they wont be total fascists there? 
2021-05-23T13:58:15  <waterytart> Andrew Lee already stole someone's channel and opped himself and removed the founders
2021-05-23T13:58:27  <waterytart> what makes you think they wont be assholes to others
2021-05-23T14:01:49  <Anastasius> LjL: Nah, in this case "faggot" is the british definition, a bundle of sticks.

2021-05-23T14:22:42  <waterytart> Except Andrew Lee. Fuck that guy. 
2021-05-23T14:23:51  <Anastasius> The King of Romania is not impressed with him.
2021-05-23T14:24:27  <waterytart> I told my friend today he can have one square foot of my land here so he can be a Lord of the land of My People
2021-05-23T14:24:44  <waterytart> is this how that sort of thing starts? 
2021-05-23T14:24:58  <Anastasius> Most likely.
2021-05-23T14:25:09  <waterytart> i give him one square foot and then he turns around and takes the house lool :D 
2021-05-23T14:25:45  <waterytart> we should make that a term.. 
2021-05-23T14:25:54  <waterytart> You got Andrew Lee'd
2021-05-23T14:26:32  <Anastasius> We should make this a meme.

2021-05-23T14:28:00  <waterytart> ugly mother fucker
2021-05-23T14:28:43  <waterytart> i wonder how much he paid for his date 
2021-05-23T14:29:10  <Anastasius> At least one meeelion dollars.
2021-05-23T14:29:41  <waterytart> looks like she spent atleat that much on facial surgery
2021-05-23T14:32:29  <spynxic> Seems like a minor payback relative to dividing their country in half
2021-05-23T14:32:39  <spynxic> Just saying..
2021-05-23T14:33:03  <waterytart> imagine being that rich and still getting owned

2021-05-23T14:34:46  <waterytart> at least dress like bill gates if you cant do a suit. shit.
2021-05-23T14:36:13  <spynxic> With dough like that I'd go full out traditional garments

2021-05-23T14:36:43  <Anastasius> Yeah, he lost the plot.

2021-05-24T10:00:06  <cym> work is chaos as always, but doing well! Had my Huel for lunch, still losing weight, got a trip booked this weekend up to the Bletchley computing museum!
2021-05-24T10:00:17  <daftykins> :O
2021-05-24T10:00:20  <cym> been in London for 4 years now, been meaning to go check out that museum for years, never quite got around to it
2021-05-24T10:00:33  <daftykins> i went very close to Bletchley once when visiting a pal who at the time was living in Bedford
2021-05-24T10:00:35  <cym> but it reopens soon
2021-05-24T10:00:39  <cym> and I am dying to go
2021-05-24T10:00:49  <cym> wife is going to be bored shitless, but I bribed her with mexican food so it's all good

2021-05-24T10:03:09  <cym> my home office is..in my living room
2021-05-24T10:03:32  <cym> problem with London is the rent is just so ridiculous even getting a fairly small flat is enormously expensive
2021-05-24T10:03:38  <cym> but I am very happy with my setup
2021-05-24T10:04:04  <m0nk> yeah, I am in central california
2021-05-24T10:04:12  <m0nk> so it is usually a bit cheaper here

2021-05-24T10:13:06  <cym> yep, my ITX build :D
2021-05-24T10:13:24  <m0nk> ITX builds are fun, I did one last year for my dad's gaming computer
2021-05-24T10:13:34  <cym> ryzen 2600, Nvidia GTX 1660 super, 32gb of ram, 1tb nvme ssd, a full size non modular ATX PSU (because I am dumb like that)
2021-05-24T10:13:41  <cym> water cooled too
2021-05-24T10:14:39  <cym> does me quite well
2021-05-24T10:15:43  <m0nk> very nice
2021-05-24T10:15:54  <m0nk> I think we build the ryzen 3800X with a GTX2060 for my dad
2021-05-24T10:17:13  <cym> the only part of this build I regret is the nvme ssd, the one I got is hot garbage and has some weird incompatibility with AMD based systems that means the write performance is total garbage
2021-05-24T10:17:48  <m0nk> thats a strange issue to encoutner
2021-05-24T10:17:52  <daftykins> o0
2021-05-24T10:18:05  <m0nk> NVME / PCI-E should remove a lot of the bull shittery like that
2021-05-24T10:19:59  <daftykins> i recently snagged another WD Black 1TB SN750, probably gonna go in my Dell R620 to replace the 250GB i have in there for testing
2021-05-24T10:20:25  <daftykins> it's a speedier VM storage repo alongside a RAID 10
2021-05-24T10:23:09  <cym> m0nk this is a nvme/pci-e drive
2021-05-24T10:23:14  <daftykins> cym: hey you have big wave as a wallpaper, do you know the meaning behind that image? :D they explain a lot of the famous art on NHK World, pretty neat
2021-05-24T10:23:49  <m0nk> cym: oh I assumed so, I was just reiterating how strange it is to have problems for you :) 
2021-05-24T10:24:01  <cym> I have no idea what the problem is exactly, but others with drives that have the Phison e12 controller encounter poor write performance on AMD based systems. I temporarily moved this drive into that Lenovo mini pc thing I have to test it there and instantly the write performance was around 20 times better
2021-05-24T10:24:10  <m0nk> cym: I wasnt jumping down troubleshooting, sometimes it just be like that
2021-05-24T10:24:18  <cym> from the 100 or so MB/s I was getting on my AMD build to the 1.9GB/s it's rated for
2021-05-24T10:24:26  <m0nk> damn
2021-05-24T10:24:27  <cym> tl;dr friends don't let friends by QLC drives
2021-05-24T10:24:33  <cym> and I didn't have a friend :(
2021-05-24T10:24:39  <daftykins> oh no i always tell everyone to avoid QLC
2021-05-24T10:24:47  <m0nk> cym: maybe ubnot2 will be your friend
2021-05-24T10:24:47  <cym> it's gar-bage
2021-05-24T10:24:54  <daftykins> :D
2021-05-24T10:25:06  <cym> daftykins I do not, but I shall research it
2021-05-24T10:25:10  <cym> I just thought it looked cool
2021-05-24T10:26:19  <daftykins> it do, the boats are fishermen bringing back some specific fish to Tokyo to sell for a high price, first one to arrive with them for the season gets much more dorrah than the rest
2021-05-24T10:27:08  <daftykins> my bad, it's called Great Wave
2021-05-24T10:27:18  <cym> https://hass.kn100.me/amd-run.png https://hass.kn100.me/intel-run.png - there you go, the AMD run is on an AMD b450 system with a Ryzen 2600 cpu, the Intel run is on an old Mini PC with an intel I5 6400T.
2021-05-24T10:27:19  <m0nk> is QLC a newer design?
2021-05-24T10:27:30  <cym> higher density storage so cheaper basically
2021-05-24T10:27:38  <daftykins> yeah quad level cell
2021-05-24T10:27:44  <m0nk> ahh ok
2021-05-24T10:27:46  <cym> it's not right on Intel either, but certainly better than on my AMD system
2021-05-24T10:27:46  <daftykins> SLC -> MLC -> TLC -> QLC
2021-05-24T10:27:56  <m0nk> is the biggest issue that they have a lower write speed in some firmwares?
2021-05-24T10:28:08  <daftykins> cym: oh i found it! save this sucker for later - https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/ondemand/video/6030001/

2021-05-24T10:28:13  <m0nk> (I am assuming whatever issue you are noting cym would boil down to firmware)
2021-05-24T10:28:37  <daftykins> yeah, Phison don't push many updates though
2021-05-24T10:28:40  <cym> Sabrent were entirely useless when I contacted them about it
2021-05-24T10:28:49  <cym> literally tried telling me that the 100MB/s write performance was normal
2021-05-24T10:28:59  <cym> in fact I kind of shamed them
2021-05-24T10:28:59  <daftykins> doh
2021-05-24T10:29:11  <daftykins> yeah it pays to go with larger brands who are likely to work harder on the firmware tbh
2021-05-24T10:29:41  <m0nk> ahh ok
2021-05-24T10:29:41  <cym> https://hass.kn100.me/drivehead2head.jpg - how I shamed them :P
2021-05-24T10:29:44  <daftykins> being in a slot that comes from CPU vs. chipset PCIe lanes would probably have some impact
2021-05-24T10:29:51  <m0nk> I typically only buy WD / Asus parts
2021-05-24T10:30:04  <m0nk> although these days servers are boring for me

2021-05-24T10:34:38  <cym> the iops heavy workloads are becoming noticably slow on this one
2021-05-24T10:35:07  <daftykins> couple of reviews i've seen suggest Samsung's early attempts on PCIe 4.0 have been a bit weak so far

2021-05-24T17:45:39  <tcoppi> unless it works on libera, the issue appeared to be that freenode was blocking sslv3 connections and that's all the old-ass version ofpython ubnotu is running on supports
2021-05-24T17:46:00  <gav> It's the combo of python2 and sqlite2 that's problematic

2021-05-24T17:46:30  <daftykins> surely all you want to do is identify and extract the factoid list at this point

2021-05-24T17:55:02  <tcoppi> it was pretty funny, I heard about this last week or whatever when it happened but didn't have a chance to get on to irc, I come on tonight and I have a message from emma and all the channels are dead lol
2021-05-24T17:55:08  <gav> Wait, did freenode die today oslt?
2021-05-24T17:55:20  <Anastasius> gav: No it's still there. Sort of.
2021-05-24T17:55:22  <tcoppi> happened pretty quickly
2021-05-24T17:55:45  <gav> Oh
2021-05-24T17:55:48  <cym> I'm so curious what is going to happen to freenode in 3 months time
2021-05-24T17:55:55  <Anastasius> tcoppi: Yeah, it's been going on for a few weeks but I think it was last Wednesday that everyone just said fuck it and moved.
2021-05-24T17:55:57  <gav> So still the same vestigial dying thing
2021-05-24T17:56:12  <Anastasius> Or Thursday.
2021-05-24T17:56:15  <cym> Is it going to become a sort of internet... North Korea?
2021-05-24T17:56:32  <Anastasius> Ask the Crown Prince about that, cym.
2021-05-24T17:56:50  <cym> They've been very hostile towards channels that openly moved it seems
2021-05-24T17:56:56  *** cym is now known as kn100
2021-05-24T17:57:21  <tcoppi> gav: sent, gave you the @seen data too so you can recreate that authentically
2021-05-24T17:57:29  <gav> Yay!
2021-05-24T17:58:17  <gav> I'll have to start hacking on this soon. Hopefully the internet at our building is back up soon.
2021-05-24T17:59:00  <Anastasius> gav: You can probably disregard any factoid entered by the entity known as "Seveas".
2021-05-24T17:59:11  <gav> LAWL OH HIM!
2021-05-24T17:59:14  <gav> I know him
2021-05-24T17:59:20  <gav> Prolly erec too
2021-05-24T18:00:13  <tcoppi> did m00se make it
2021-05-24T18:00:18  <gav> Back from the early days
2021-05-24T18:00:21  <gav> tcoppi: yes
2021-05-24T18:00:24  <Anastasius> Well to be fair we perverted a lot of Seveas factoids along the way.
2021-05-24T18:00:33  <tcoppi> he told me to buy a kubota, he'll be happy to know that I am now seriously considering one
2021-05-24T18:00:41  <LjL> Anastasius, he'd probably approve
2021-05-24T18:01:20  <gav> ^
2021-05-24T18:01:27  <Anastasius> tcoppi: What, like a mower?
2021-05-24T18:01:32  <LjL> Anastasius, he once tried to throw either elky or Hobbsee into a pool (don't remember which of them, sorry).
2021-05-24T18:01:35  <tcoppi> tractor

2021-05-24T18:04:17  <Anastasius> tcoppi: Huh, neat. Did you buy a bigger place or something? With land?
2021-05-24T18:04:28  <tcoppi> yeah got 3.5 acres now
2021-05-24T18:04:37  <tcoppi> with a big lawn. sloped
2021-05-24T18:04:38  <Anastasius> Oh lawdy, that'll be fun. :D
2021-05-24T18:05:15  <tcoppi> just got done building a playground for the minions
2021-05-24T18:05:27  <tcoppi> would have been super handy to have a tractor while doing that
2021-05-24T18:05:51  <tcoppi> now I have a ton of wood to split, and some land to clear for my apple orchard I need to plant this fall/winter
2021-05-24T18:06:59  <Anastasius> :D
2021-05-24T18:07:02  <Anastasius> Good times!
2021-05-24T18:07:25  <Anastasius> It's definitely nice having a piece of land with which you can do whatever the fuck you want.
2021-05-24T18:07:53  <tcoppi> yep
2021-05-24T18:08:33  <kn100> I am very curious of that
2021-05-24T18:08:47  <kn100> I can't even put things on my walls without asking permission
2021-05-24T18:09:03  <kn100> Jealous* damn autocorrect 
2021-05-24T18:09:14  <tcoppi> with great power comes great responsibility
2021-05-24T18:11:12  <tcoppi> I also have 400ft of driveway, partially gravel, that I have to clear of snow in the winter
2021-05-24T18:11:15  <tcoppi> and maintain in other months

2021-05-24T18:13:15  <kn100> tcoppi I get that, it's just I feel that if I owned a place I'd do so much more with it. Frustrating to live in a situation where every little change you want to make to it has to be run by the bloody landlord heh

2021-05-24T18:13:34  <Anastasius> (protip: It's a pain in the ass most of the time)
2021-05-24T18:14:13  <waterytart> We found tcoppi !!
2021-05-24T18:14:35  <tcoppi> it is a pain. but I wouldn't ever go back to renting
2021-05-24T18:14:39  <tcoppi> not at this stage of my life anyway
2021-05-24T18:15:00  <tcoppi> we did! who is waterytart lol
2021-05-24T18:15:07  <kn100> It's just so annoying, so many little repairs I could do in this flat that I just won't because I'll be out of here In a year 
2021-05-24T18:15:15  <kn100> So many upgrades I could do
2021-05-24T18:15:24  <kn100> I'm sure you understand the feeling 
2021-05-24T18:16:00  <waterytart> \o/
2021-05-24T18:16:39  <tcoppi> big advantage of renting is you can move whenever and wherever you want. big disadvantage of it as well since you will probably have to to keep the rent down
2021-05-24T18:16:42  <Anastasius> tcoppi: waterytart be suzy

2021-05-24T20:49:57  <Anastasius> kevinf311-lap: Hmm, I guess I could x-files for a bit. Forgot about that.
2021-05-24T20:50:58  <kevinf311-lap> this was the episode with Jodie Foster as a tattoo that tries to convince Gillian Anderson's boyfriend to not have sex with her after convincing him to kill the downstairs neighbor  
2021-05-24T20:51:35  <Anastasius> Oh man, I forgot about that one!
2021-05-24T20:52:37  <Anastasius> Still prime X-Files era.
2021-05-24T20:53:00  <Anastasius> Isn't that a "Millenium" tat?
2021-05-24T20:53:43  <Anastasius> Oh, it's the guy from Space: Above and Beyond too, innit?
2021-05-24T20:53:56  <LjL> any of you ever play 0AD?
2021-05-24T20:54:43  <Anastasius> LjL: Probably not, but what is is?
2021-05-24T20:54:52  <Anastasius> it*
2021-05-24T20:55:05  <LjL> Anastasius, i've heard it described as an open source Age of Empires clone, but i've never played Age of Empires so i'm not sure how accurate it is
2021-05-24T20:55:17  <LjL> it is being actively developed and i play it against the AI
2021-05-24T20:55:37  <LjL> i used to play it against someone real (and consistently lost) but they've gone away because i'm an unpleasant person
2021-05-24T20:55:53  <Anastasius> LjL: Are you on Steam at all?
2021-05-24T20:56:12  <LjL> Anastasius, i do have an account, but i haven't touched it in ages
2021-05-24T20:56:36  <LjL> i am still kind of an open source purist. somewhat.
2021-05-24T20:56:45  <Anastasius> LjL: Well sometimes we do Tabletop Simulator and other games, but rarely.
2021-05-24T20:56:55  <LjL> isn't that the VR one?
2021-05-24T20:56:56  <Anastasius> If'n you want to join. And stuff.
2021-05-24T20:57:04  <kevinf311-lap> i like that they mixed tattoo-Jodie as panning back and forth through the channels to make her seem more "voices in the head"
2021-05-24T20:57:12  <Anastasius> It can be VR but doesn't have to be.
2021-05-24T20:57:14  <LjL> ah
2021-05-24T20:57:27  <LjL> i played with some Google (Cardboard, Daydream) VR but they killed it all
2021-05-24T20:57:33  <LjL> the actual PC VR is too expensive for the nothing i do
2021-05-24T20:58:22  <Anastasius> LjL: Well friend us on Steam if you want, we might get around to some gaming over the weekend.
2021-05-24T20:58:58  <LjL> i'll see if i remember my password
2021-05-24T20:59:09  <LjL> i'm sure it starts with hunter but don't remember the rest
2021-05-24T20:59:17  <Anastasius> kevinf311-lap: lol, Mulder.
2021-05-24T20:59:29  <waterytart> if it's hunter2 you need to change it
2021-05-24T20:59:34  <waterytart> because that's my password.
2021-05-24T20:59:40  <LjL> i'm sorry, i had it first
2021-05-24T20:59:44  <waterytart> biter 
2021-05-24T20:59:58  <waterytart> lol
2021-05-24T21:00:00  <kevinf311-lap> y'all just posting 6 or 7 asterisks isn't funny
2021-05-24T21:00:10  <waterytart> you'll never know!
2021-05-24T21:01:04  <kevinf311-lap> Anastasius: now we have Memento Mori (the previous episode was supposed to come before Leonard Betts) 
2021-05-24T21:01:33  <Anastasius> kevinf311-lap: Why so out of order? And why no "Home"?
2021-05-24T21:01:46  <kevinf311-lap> out of order was because Fox
2021-05-24T21:02:05  <kevinf311-lap> they thought that Leonard Betts would draw a bigger ratings crowd after the Superbowl 
2021-05-24T21:02:22  <kevinf311-lap> and no Home is because it apparently was too disturbing to be run in syndication 
2021-05-24T21:02:45  <Anastasius> Boo, hiss.
2021-05-24T21:02:58  <Anastasius> But I did catch Leonard Betts the other day.
2021-05-24T21:03:14  <Anastasius> Still. Creepy.
2021-05-24T21:03:16  <LjL> now that freenode vs libera stuff is starting to slightly settle down, i'm starting to be bored again
2021-05-24T21:03:42  <LjL> maybe i should try to register myself for getting the vaccine until the website eventually concedes that my age is not so young
2021-05-24T21:03:47  <Anastasius> LjL: But you and emma registered so many channels, how could you be bored?
2021-05-24T21:03:51  <Anastasius> :D
2021-05-24T21:04:02  <kevinf311-lap> hehe
2021-05-24T21:04:10  <LjL> Anastasius, well it's different, emma is creating vibrant communities around them, i'm just having my bot spit the usual stuff from reddit
2021-05-24T21:04:22  <kevinf311-lap> so are we starting an open source social-sciences github for this channel?
2021-05-24T21:04:45  <Anastasius> Oh god I hope not. That's too much work.
2021-05-24T21:04:58  <LjL> i have a gigantic covid-19 document on github
2021-05-24T21:05:05  <LjL> that nobody reads, me included
2021-05-24T21:07:00  <Anastasius> Sometimes, and just sometimes, I still see David Duchovny as Special Agent Denise Bryson from Twin Peaks.
2021-05-24T21:07:16  <Anastasius> Wig and all.
2021-05-24T21:07:31  <kevinf311-lap> i try to link them together in the same universe as often as possible 
2021-05-24T21:07:39  <Anastasius> :D
2021-05-24T21:07:51  <kevinf311-lap> just like Scully's dad, his character in Twin Peaks, and General Hammond of earth
2021-05-24T21:08:00  <Anastasius> Yes!
2021-05-24T21:08:23  <Anastasius> I didn't realize that was the same guy until this rewatch.
2021-05-24T21:08:38  <kevinf311-lap> Don S Davis was the best "fatherly military man" until we got Edward James Olmos ad Adama 
2021-05-24T21:08:47  <kevinf311-lap> as*
2021-05-24T21:08:53  <Anastasius> ^
2021-05-24T21:09:12  <kevinf311-lap> he was even actually former Military!
2021-05-24T21:09:33  <Anastasius> It figures. He was a good old Missouri boy.
2021-05-24T21:09:53  <kevinf311-lap> :D
2021-05-24T21:10:05  <Anastasius> The military training definitely came out in his various roles, too.
2021-05-24T21:15:59  <Anastasius> Scully. :(
2021-05-24T21:16:17  <kevinf311-lap> yeah, this is a rough episode for her
2021-05-24T21:16:24  <kevinf311-lap> she won an emmy for it thought!
2021-05-24T21:16:26  <kevinf311-lap> though*
2021-05-24T21:16:42  <Anastasius> She did?
2021-05-24T21:18:05  <kevinf311-lap> according to the trivia anyway
2021-05-24T21:18:29  <kevinf311-lap> "This is the episode for which Gillian Anderson won the Best Actress Emmy.  " -super reliable imdb trivia
2021-05-24T21:18:41  <Anastasius> :D
2021-05-24T21:19:02  <Anastasius> Such a good show at any rate, still.
2021-05-24T21:19:07  <kevinf311-lap> indeed
2021-05-24T21:19:16  <kevinf311-lap> it could've been so terrible based on its premise 
2021-05-24T21:19:46  <kevinf311-lap> but everyone involved was so dedicated to making the best version of it they could (until the post movie seasons) 
2021-05-24T21:21:05  <daftykins> which ep?
2021-05-24T21:22:15  <Anastasius> daftykins: Memento Mori
2021-05-24T21:22:18  <Anastasius> s4
2021-05-24T21:22:25  <edenist> I still see David Duchovny as Brad, the 'evil' yuppy investor in Beethoven ;-)
2021-05-24T21:22:39  <Anastasius> edenist: :D
2021-05-24T21:24:23  * edenist promises Anastasius he didn't just watch Beethoven recently because it was in the 'recently added' section of netflix
2021-05-24T21:24:37  <kevinf311-lap> oh shit, is it?!
2021-05-24T21:24:51  <Anastasius> kevinf311-lap: Oddly enough, I was reading the other day that Duchovny is the total skeptic and Gillian is a true believer.
2021-05-24T21:24:52  <edenist> well.... it is in my region anyway
2021-05-24T21:24:59  <Anastasius> So, role reversal.
2021-05-24T21:25:05  <kevinf311-lap> yeah, i'd buy that
2021-05-24T21:25:49  <edenist> I, too, am on a x-files rewatch though :-) I love it almost as much for the 90's nostalgia trip
2021-05-24T21:26:23  <Anastasius> edenist: Yeah, we're just catching it on Comet as it airs there. It's convenient.
2021-05-24T21:28:13  <kevinf311-lap> background tv noise that is ALSO something i enjoy?
2021-05-24T21:28:18  <kevinf311-lap> heaven 
2021-05-24T21:28:40  <Anastasius> Nice when it happens, right?
2021-05-24T21:29:45  <Anastasius> Although the commercial breaks still suck.
2021-05-24T21:30:16  <kevinf311-lap> yep
2021-05-24T21:35:39  <Anastasius> Mitch.
2021-05-24T21:35:59  <daftykins> he always took so much shit from Mulder, didn't really make sense why
2021-05-24T21:36:03  <kevinf311-lap> "You can't ask the truth of a man who trades in lies."
2021-05-24T21:36:04  <Anastasius> And the Lone Gunmen.
2021-05-24T21:36:22  <kevinf311-lap> good eveni...early morning, daftykins!
2021-05-24T21:36:29  <daftykins> >:D
2021-05-24T21:36:33  <daftykins> g'day sir
2021-05-24T21:37:15  <kevinf311-lap> haha
2021-05-24T21:37:21  <kevinf311-lap> such a sick in-universe burn
2021-05-24T21:37:31  <Anastasius> :D
2021-05-24T21:37:34  <kevinf311-lap> "Oh Mr. Skinner; which way is the elevator?"
2021-05-24T21:38:29  <Anastasius> William B. Davis is by all accounts a super cool guy, so he must have enjoyed the hell out of this.
2021-05-24T21:39:00  <Anastasius> The CSM part.
2021-05-24T21:39:23  <kevinf311-lap> yeah!
2021-05-24T21:39:48  <kevinf311-lap> i actually have an old co-worker friend that looks like a young William B Davis 
2021-05-24T21:39:59  <kevinf311-lap> i'm excited to see if his aging continues to track XD
2021-05-24T21:40:01  <daftykins> woot!
2021-05-24T21:41:04  <kevinf311-lap> it's too bad the Lone Gunmen series didn't make it
2021-05-24T21:41:09  <kevinf311-lap> i understand why
2021-05-24T21:41:13  <kevinf311-lap> but it's still too bad
2021-05-24T21:41:18  <Anastasius> Haven't seen him in too much since this, aside from his decidedly short run on Caprica.
2021-05-24T21:41:31  <kevinf311-lap> yeah
2021-05-24T21:41:46  <kevinf311-lap> wonder if the X-Files money was enough for him to retire comfortably on
2021-05-24T21:41:49  <Anastasius> Yeah, that was 2001 wasn't it? Lone Gunmen.... for like 12 episodes.
2021-05-24T21:41:54  <kevinf311-lap> yeah
2021-05-24T21:41:58  <Anastasius> Before 9/11.
2021-05-24T21:42:03  <kevinf311-lap> yep
2021-05-24T21:44:07  <kevinf311-lap> RENT A COPS
2021-05-24T21:45:28  <Anastasius> This whole show is sort of a wayback to a more comfortable time, and it really shouldn't be.
2021-05-24T21:45:43  <kevinf311-lap> i know
2021-05-24T21:45:57  <kevinf311-lap> i feel the same way about a lot of SG-1 as well
2021-05-24T21:46:04  <kevinf311-lap> really anything on Comet
2021-05-24T21:46:23  <Anastasius> Quantum Leap too, when I manage to catch it.
2021-05-24T21:46:35  <kevinf311-lap> yep
2021-05-24T21:46:44  <kevinf311-lap> it has its own topical commentary 
2021-05-24T21:47:04  <kevinf311-lap> but it is so far removed from our current shit show that it seems almost optimistic in comparison 
2021-05-24T21:47:33  <Anastasius> That's exactly it, and why all of it is enjoyable.
2021-05-24T21:47:38  <kevinf311-lap> yep!
2021-05-24T21:48:28  <kevinf311-lap> Knight Rider and Magnum P.I. on Charge! for the same reasons 
2021-05-24T21:48:41  <kevinf311-lap> less-so Walker Texas Ranger 
2021-05-24T21:48:54  <kevinf311-lap> i catch the rare episode of that and it... didn't age well
2021-05-24T21:49:01  <Anastasius> Knight Rider doesn't really hold up for me, but Magnum does.
2021-05-24T21:49:29  <kevinf311-lap> Knight Rider didn't really exist in its own time period so i feel it isn't any more displaced now :D
2021-05-24T21:49:57  <Anastasius> At least the old Magnum with Selleck. I guess there's been a reboot I haven't paid attention to.
2021-05-24T21:49:58  <kevinf311-lap> Magnum P.I. I've actually appreciated more in recent months/years 
2021-05-24T21:50:05  <kevinf311-lap> yeah, old Magnum 
2021-05-24T21:50:35  <kevinf311-lap> when i was younger it was a campy crime procedural with flashy cars and Hawaiian landscapes 
2021-05-24T21:51:09  <kevinf311-lap> but now i'm more primed to accept the deeper tones in the narration and vietnam war-vet storylines 
2021-05-24T21:51:12  <Anastasius> Yeah, some episodes though. Like the one where he confronted "Ivan".
2021-05-24T21:51:20  <kevinf311-lap> yeah
2021-05-24T21:51:27  <Anastasius> When Mac got esploded.
2021-05-24T21:51:31  <daftykins> i watched some with snaked, he played Magnum, he gave me a bad role
2021-05-24T21:51:40  <daftykins> Higgins that's his name
2021-05-24T21:51:44  <kevinf311-lap> haha
2021-05-24T21:51:54  <Anastasius> daftykins: Yes, you were Higgins!
2021-05-24T21:51:54  <kevinf311-lap> cast solely on the accent range 
2021-05-24T21:51:55  <daftykins> i like to think i'd wear the safari gear better
2021-05-24T21:52:02  <daftykins> yep!
2021-05-24T21:52:09  <kevinf311-lap> and your time in north africa with the gents
2021-05-24T21:52:15  <Anastasius> I think I was TC or Rick.
2021-05-24T21:52:19  <Anastasius> Probably Rick.
2021-05-24T21:52:22  <edenist> > "it is so far removed from our current shit show..." | This is exactly what I am feeling! 
2021-05-24T21:52:24  <kevinf311-lap> probably rick 
2021-05-24T21:53:08  <Anastasius> Nightclub owner, probably an asshole. That fits.
2021-05-24T21:53:18  <daftykins> speaking of Knight Rider, did you know there's a youtube channel with a couple of guys that are currently restoring the original truck that pulled the trailer?
2021-05-24T21:53:26  <kevinf311-lap> at least you get to drive a Mercedes!
2021-05-24T21:53:40  <kevinf311-lap> i did not know this!
2021-05-24T21:53:42  <daftykins> they found it disused for years, sat in a field on rural Ohio iirc... painted blue
2021-05-24T21:53:51  <kevinf311-lap> The Knight Industries Mobile Command Center?!
2021-05-24T21:53:57  <daftykins> none other!
2021-05-24T21:54:21  <kevinf311-lap> that was a tractor trailer on the outside and totally not a soundstage on the inside?
2021-05-24T21:54:37  <daftykins> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jRjVqtNn0c

2021-05-24T21:54:57  <Anastasius> intro*
2021-05-24T21:55:32  <Anastasius> Maybe it was the other fat guy  who played "Cannon".
2021-05-24T21:56:16  <kevinf311-lap> imdb claims Richard Basehart 
2021-05-24T21:56:21  <Anastasius> Scully. :(
2021-05-24T21:56:47  <kevinf311-lap> posthumously apparently!
2021-05-24T21:57:35  <Anastasius> kevinf311-lap: That would make sense. Admiral whatshisface from Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea seems right.
2021-05-24T21:57:44  <Anastasius> Nelson.
2021-05-24T21:57:52  <kevinf311-lap> mmhm
2021-05-24T21:58:56  <Anastasius> Oh, the kiss.
2021-05-24T21:59:00  <kevinf311-lap> my dad had a similar era Firebird 
2021-05-24T21:59:13  <kevinf311-lap> i think that's only in the deleted scenes 
2021-05-24T21:59:22  <daftykins> i saw one over here once! didn't fit down local roads
2021-05-24T21:59:35  <kevinf311-lap> Firebird or semi?!
2021-05-24T21:59:41  <daftykins> Firebird :D
2021-05-24T21:59:46  <kevinf311-lap> O.O
2021-05-24T22:00:04  <kevinf311-lap> how am i to take my sunday constitutional in the Tesla Model S then?!
2021-05-24T22:00:17  * daftykins ponders
2021-05-24T22:00:22  <daftykins> are they really a comparable width o0
2021-05-24T22:00:27  <kevinf311-lap> she's a bit wider in the hips than a Firebird i think 
2021-05-24T22:01:25  <daftykins> you might have to do what my brother did when he had the Audi R8, take very specific routes
2021-05-24T22:01:45  <kevinf311-lap> yep, 1.8m vs 2.2m
2021-05-24T22:02:16  <kevinf311-lap> closer to 2m if you fold in the mirrors 
2021-05-24T22:04:07  <daftykins> there's still talk of them introducing an MOT here, the road-worthiness and emissions type test
2021-05-24T22:06:03  <kevinf311-lap> emissions for EVs here is just chuckling at each other and handing the state $5
2021-05-24T22:06:15  <daftykins> :D
2021-05-24T22:06:30  <kevinf311-lap> safety/road-worthiness is sorta part of it i think
2021-05-24T22:07:36  <daftykins> sun's up, i better go! *hiss*
2021-05-24T22:07:45  <daftykins> g'night all \o

2021-05-24T22:10:34  <kevinf311-lap> hmm, i hope that the Memorial Day X-Files marathon doesn't advance the M-Th serial airing 
2021-05-24T22:13:39  <Anastasius> Is that going to be a thing? Because they will do that.
2021-05-24T22:14:12  <kevinf311-lap> the commercial advertised 15hrs of X-files on Monday starting at 10
2021-05-24T22:14:30  <kevinf311-lap> i guess it'll be easy enough to check on the website
2021-05-24T22:14:43  <Anastasius> I always hated when they would do that with BSG, too, because a weekend would go by when I wasn't paying attention and suddenly we were a season ahead the next time I tuned in.

2021-05-24T23:10:15  <Anastasius> gav: Recent development or did you move?
2021-05-24T23:10:52  <gav> Recent. Was working fine last night, out this morning, and now it's still down
2021-05-24T23:11:08  <gav> Not just my internet connection, the building WiFi has nothing too
2021-05-24T23:11:26  <Anastasius> Hmm hmm, Did you get the ubnotu db from tcoppi though?
2021-05-24T23:15:00  <gav> Yeah, I got it on my phone. I just need WiFi to put it on the server and actually start playing with it
2021-05-24T23:16:19  <gav> Converting it to a format that is new enough to be viable is easy, just sqlite2 dump ubuntu.db | sqlite3 import (or something like that)
2021-05-24T23:17:01  <Anastasius> Right on.
2021-05-24T23:17:20  <gav> But then I have to figure out if I can mangleage the DB to make the new bot read it or if I have to manually start extracting bits and putting them into the new DB
2021-05-24T23:18:39  <gav> And who knows how that will go!
2021-05-24T23:22:31  <gav> Anastasius: oh, they started getting the I70 viaduct GONE
2021-05-24T23:27:52  <Anastasius> GOOD.
2021-05-24T23:28:04  <Anastasius> That whole thing was a nightmare.
2021-05-24T23:28:51  <Anastasius> gav: But more importantly, what's the status of Casa Bonita?
2021-05-24T23:29:06  <gav> Someone started a gofundme
2021-05-24T23:29:22  <gav> I don't think it's gonna happen. It's not looking good
2021-05-24T23:29:57  <Anastasius> :(
2021-05-24T23:30:20  <gav> Maybe if someone buys them, but I don't see that happening. Someone said they wanted to get a big group of people together to pool money and buy it, then hire decent chefs and start serving good food and actually fixing the broken stuff in there.
2021-05-24T23:33:28  <gav> Anastasius: want a milkshake? https://redd.it/nk5pb9
2021-05-24T23:35:32  <Anastasius> Not that variety.

2021-05-25T14:30:10  <lhave> Sends every 20 minutes, it seems.
2021-05-25T14:30:14  <Anastasius> 'twas only a matter of time.
2021-05-25T14:30:18  <lhave> yep.
2021-05-25T14:30:27  <lhave> sooner rather than later is good.
2021-05-25T14:31:33  <Anastasius> Things went down more quickly than I expected.
2021-05-25T14:31:54  <Anastasius> And libera is already a lot huger than I figured it would be.

2021-05-25T15:12:55  <CoJaBo> kn100: Apparently we refunded them for some reason. Our policies clearly state that you get back the amount you paid denominated in the currency the item was priced in(?), which somehow ended up being three (3) cents less than they originally paid. They then raised absolute hell at being shorted 3 cents, even tho due to exchange rate or some other nonsense, they technically weren't shorted
2021-05-25T15:15:28  <daftykins> :)
2021-05-25T15:16:33  <CoJaBo> This initially started about 4 months ago. They continued to complain with such persistence, that this morning our support guy mailed them three (3) pennies laminated to a postcard.
2021-05-25T15:17:41  <Anastasius> :D
2021-05-25T15:19:08  <CoJaBo> This reminds me of that one old Bash quote
2021-05-25T15:19:38  <kn100> oh man
2021-05-25T15:19:46  <kn100> I am so glad I don't generally have to deal with customers
2021-05-25T15:19:52  <kn100> I'd have flown off the handle with bullcrap like that
2021-05-25T15:20:16  <CoJaBo> This level of stupid happens quite regularly <_<
2021-05-25T15:20:26  <Anastasius> All this over 3 fucking cents?
2021-05-25T15:20:29  <CoJaBo> I have no idea how I maintain my grip on sanity
2021-05-25T15:20:43  <Tamara> can't argue with that
2021-05-25T15:21:31  <CoJaBo> Anastasius: There's a Yelp review that's basically the same thing but over one (1) cent
2021-05-25T15:21:40  <CoJaBo> So this happens.. often, apparently

2021-05-25T16:53:13  <elcasey> daftykins: load of bollocks innit, but I guess if it thinned the herd and got some of the old gang chattin again then maybe it's good?

2021-05-25T16:54:39  <elcasey> since it's the same old gang running it, the ones we never liked before either :P
2021-05-25T16:55:08  <elcasey> but I don't really have a major stake in any of this because I find the idea of "IRC politics" completely ludicrous :D
2021-05-25T16:55:14  <elcasey> anyway, here I am!

2021-05-25T17:00:43  <Anastasius> All I really want is to see this place gassed up again and not running on fumes.
2021-05-25T17:01:04  <Anastasius> We've all been here for roughly forever, so let's try to do it up right again, if we can.

2021-05-25T17:45:20  <LjL> elcasey, the politics determine whether what you want to say eventually can be said, and if (say) Anastasius or em decide that it can be said, those same politics then determine that this channel may not necessarily be "on topic" anymore

2021-05-25T17:54:40  <elcasey> LjL: I agree with that. But I think you'd also agree that MY politics are very much in the "not allowed on the internet anymore" category. So maybe you're right :)

2021-05-25T17:55:33  <elcasey> but yeah i always l o l @ some twammer putting am/pm on it
2021-05-25T17:55:37  <LjL> elcasey, more like compartimentalized in just one section of the internet, with other politics having their own section (possibly larger). while i don't generally like your politics, i also don't quite like what's going on with this.
2021-05-25T17:55:42  <CoJaBo> elcasey: Use both! Confound the hell out of your fiends and enemies!
2021-05-25T17:56:19  <elcasey> LjL: yep, agreeing! I am a defender of FREEDOM, including people with whom I vehemently disagree! So maybe you're right, maybe that's what this is about and I was just too sour grapes to see it at first

2021-05-25T17:57:14  <elcasey> CoJaBo: I was just going to ignore freenode and not join this network
2021-05-25T17:57:19  <LjL> perhaps i should have it about places off of the internet too, but who's seen those anymore?
2021-05-25T17:57:33  <CoJaBo> elcasey: Freenode? What's that?
2021-05-25T17:57:41  <elcasey> LjL: well maybe it's the start of a "correction" of this insanity that took hold over the last couple years? fingers crossed
2021-05-25T17:58:03  <elcasey> I'm looking at it as "a bunch of ircops wankers fighting with each other" but maybe it was way more important?

2021-05-25T17:58:43  <Tamara> I can't get over the irony of lee ranting about cancel culture in a post where he links to a news article about joepie ~associating with the wrong people~
2021-05-25T17:59:12  <LjL> elcasey, there is that, but it's always inextricably tied to... other things, recurring themes: homotransphobia as i've heard it referred to recently, and other things
2021-05-25T17:59:20  <elcasey> i can't get over fucking cancel culture existing at all
2021-05-25T17:59:39  <Tamara> i'm trying to imagine having a conversation with myself a few years ago about this shit lmfao
2021-05-25T17:59:41  <CoJaBo> elcasey: Apparently we refunded someone for some reason.

2021-05-25T17:59:46  <LjL> Tamara, he just banned joepie from his #freenode-policy-feedback after joepie asked the same (perfectly legit) question a bit too many times without getting answered
2021-05-25T17:59:59  <CoJaBo> This initially started about 4 months ago. They continued to complain with such persistence, that this morning our support guy mailed them three (3) pennies laminated to a postcard. Madlads.

2021-05-25T18:00:17  <elcasey> I was quite worried about the "desired content and behavior" section of the TOS here
2021-05-25T18:00:24  <elcasey> but it looks like freenode has gone full insanity

2021-05-25T18:02:05  <CoJaBo> I still want to know what someone aksed(?) that was so worthy of a ban lol
2021-05-25T18:02:21  <Anastasius> elcasey: Oh, looks good!
2021-05-25T18:02:31  <Tamara> I imagine probably the same annoying questions joepie has been very persistent about
2021-05-25T18:02:36  <elcasey> Anastasius: most of that is curry powder but if you haven't done it, trust me
2021-05-25T18:02:49  <Anastasius> :D
2021-05-25T18:02:51  <elcasey> Anastasius: it all cooks down into a delicious mix, and I usually do this on thighs

2021-05-25T18:03:47  <Tamara> not too surprising but oh dear nonetheless
2021-05-25T18:03:54  <LjL> Anastasius, except this channel was literally meant as questions and feedback on the new policy
2021-05-25T18:04:08  *** Lando-SpacePimp <Lando-SpacePimp!~Lando@user/lando-spacepimp> has joined ##club-nomicon
2021-05-25T18:04:11  <CoJaBo> LjL: ..yeh, Freenode has never really cared to enforce any kind of policy against those things, even before Der Führer
2021-05-25T18:04:14  <Anastasius> LjL: Yes of course. Until it isn't.
2021-05-25T18:04:44  <elcasey> lol "community standards" and "community feedback" are never good signs
2021-05-25T18:04:54  <LjL> CoJaBo, well, i suspect they'll enforce it more now. i mean Libera will.
2021-05-25T18:04:57  <elcasey> i.e. "we will censor the shit out of whoever we feel like"
2021-05-25T18:05:06  <Tamara> I doubt it'll be enforced any more than it was before
2021-05-25T18:05:12  <CoJaBo> LjL: I'll believe it when I see it.
2021-05-25T18:05:13  <Tamara> It's the same staff after all anyway
2021-05-25T18:05:26  <elcasey> enforcing peoples' thoughts and words ... what a great world we live in
2021-05-25T18:05:36  <LjL> CoJaBo, Tamara: problem is (if perceived as a problem) that if it gets enforced the way it's written, then this channel is gone.
2021-05-25T18:05:45  <pteague_laptop> there can only be 1 ... yet again
2021-05-25T18:05:47  <Tamara> oh?
2021-05-25T18:05:49  <elcasey> Tamara: bingo! same staff1
2021-05-25T18:05:51  <Tamara> why is this channel so awful
2021-05-25T18:06:09  <CoJaBo> Lets maybe, not make the channel awful
2021-05-25T18:06:14  <Tamara> I kinda remember it being referenced as having a reputation but I don't know what the reputation *is*
2021-05-25T18:06:21  <elcasey> Make This Channel Awful Again
2021-05-25T18:06:23  <Tamara> except that for some reason it's bad
2021-05-25T18:06:25  <Anastasius> I will die on a cross before this channel is canceled. I mean that. I've invested way too much time here.
2021-05-25T18:06:26  *** deniska <deniska!~denis@user/deniska> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 272 seconds)
2021-05-25T18:06:32  <elcasey> Anastasius: fuckin right
2021-05-25T18:06:33  *** deniska <deniska!~denis@185.185.57.239> has joined ##club-nomicon
2021-05-25T18:06:42  <LjL> Tamara, because this channel has always stood for free speech including some unpleasant things, and also because some staff have been very aggressively against (although other staff embarrassingly tried to change the tune afterwards) "##" channels in general, i.e. things that are neither project channels, nor things directly related to FOSS like say a "programming" channel.
2021-05-25T18:06:45  <Anastasius> Whether that means anything or not remains to be seen.
2021-05-25T18:06:53  <elcasey> Anastasius: best way is to just stay off the cancel queens' radar though
2021-05-25T18:06:56  <LjL> emma asked whether a channel about economics would be okay, and, well, in the end she got quieted
2021-05-25T18:07:05  <elcasey> surprise
2021-05-25T18:07:07  <LjL> but even before getting quieted, the answer was basically "no, this is not reddit, here it's about FOSS"
2021-05-25T18:07:10  <Anastasius> elcasey: Of course.
2021-05-25T18:07:12  <elcasey> "fuck off to undernet"
2021-05-25T18:07:18  <LjL> pretty much yes
2021-05-25T18:07:22  <elcasey> reddit is pure shit as well
2021-05-25T18:07:25  <LjL> they said "you should look at other networks"
2021-05-25T18:07:30  <elcasey> but this "you can only talk about what we say you can" is fucked
2021-05-25T18:07:43  <Anastasius> LjL: No. This will not stand.
2021-05-25T18:07:57  <CoJaBo> Freenode is being sued for not enforcing their policies lol
2021-05-25T18:08:05  <elcasey> see, I never had all these pipe dreams about the free speech utopia of LiberiaNet
2021-05-25T18:08:11  <elcasey> I read their TOS
2021-05-25T18:08:16  <elcasey> (thanks to hateball actually)
2021-05-25T18:08:20  <Tamara> fednode is fednode I guess
2021-05-25T18:08:53  <elcasey> the fact that they set themselves up in Sweden is telling to begin with (and I am not bashing Swedish people but they have some fucked laws)
2021-05-25T18:09:28  <elcasey> why not put the servers in NL or Singapore or wherever? I am just throwing things out there, there may well be reasons
2021-05-25T18:09:49  <Tamara> I'd assume the staff have some connection to Sweden, although I might be wrong
2021-05-25T18:10:02  <elcasey> and I shouldn't say it's "telling". It just made me a little suspicious.
2021-05-25T18:10:11  <Tamara> Not that there's any excuse for that, Norway is the best nordic country ofc
2021-05-25T18:10:31  <elcasey> FOSS should not equal "leftist political police"
2021-05-25T18:10:50  <LjL> Tamara, elcasey, Anastasius: well if you've time to waste and haven't read this already, here's the logs i've put together about all this so far, check the caveat, they're all from #libera iirc

2021-05-25T18:11:15  <elcasey> anyway, hey, we're all here, enjoying (so far) each other's company
2021-05-25T18:11:21  <elcasey> nobody is yelling at each other
2021-05-25T18:11:29  <elcasey> and nobody is fucking with us (yet)
2021-05-25T18:11:33  <elcasey> so let's enjoy that :)
2021-05-25T18:11:45  <pteague_laptop> good grief ... i do not like some of the clauses in this lease agreement ... if you have an alcohol license & you move your business you have to give up the alcohol license to the owner of the shopping area
2021-05-25T18:11:56  <Tamara> heh
2021-05-25T18:12:02  <elcasey> which is probably what the Mensheviks said in 1917 before they were all brutally murdered by NKVD death squads xD
2021-05-25T18:12:34  <Tamara> interesting that maths is considered on-topic but economics isn't
2021-05-25T18:12:37  <elcasey> pteague_laptop: that's fairly standard in some places actually. the liquor license stays with the "place"
2021-05-25T18:12:42  <pteague_laptop> 1 of the sections states that you're supposed to give earnings reports to the shopping center & you have to pay them 5% on top of your rent o.O
2021-05-25T18:12:54  <elcasey> Tamara: because you might talk about income, or how to earn money
2021-05-25T18:13:08  <elcasey> and money is bad
2021-05-25T18:13:10  <LjL> but it's pretty arbitrary
2021-05-25T18:13:40  <Tamara> oh I don't think it's so deep as that, I imagine the rationale is that maths is related to computer shit while economics is external
2021-05-25T18:13:45  <Tamara> but it's still a bit arbitrary
2021-05-25T18:14:12  <LjL> Tamara, then what of ##English, a channel with a long history on freenode? it is... not a programming language, but still a language, so relevant? ;P
2021-05-25T18:14:23  <LjL> if so then economics is relevant because foss influences the economy and vice versa
2021-05-25T18:14:37  <LjL> or whatever. relevance with anything could be made up, and also denied by staff on a whim
2021-05-25T18:14:48  <CoJaBo> wasn't the one*
2021-05-25T18:14:56  <Tamara> that does seem a bit "convenient" then
2021-05-25T18:15:01  <pteague_laptop> also have to pay a percentage of the property tax based on the square footage of your store vs the whole shopping center sq footage ... & then if you do anything to cause the property rate to go up, you owe the owner the extra
2021-05-25T18:16:05  <LjL> Tamara, it is possible that jose was just being a bit over the top. i think i included one or two of nicole's statement that sort of implied it (they wouldn't literally say "wait, no, you're wrong" to a fellow staffer in public, and that is maybe a problem)... but then amdj sorta kinda reiterated that yes, you could make channels, but yes, they can take them away from you on a whim (my interpretation of his long message, anyway)
2021-05-25T18:17:57  <LjL> but anyway their *written* policies, imo, back jose's statements mostly
2021-05-25T18:18:15  <LjL> i hope they'll change something and make them a bit less... drastic about channels that aren't the chosen ones
2021-05-25T18:18:58  <LjL> but the reality i've been told is that "the cabal" (presumably christel, tomaw, kloeri, and dunno who) actually kept the other staff back against taking over channels they didn't like
2021-05-25T18:19:15  <LjL> now those are gone, and current staff is more willing to ditch channels that should "move to undernet"
2021-05-25T18:19:18  <Anastasius> Hey. If they want #ubuntu-uncensored back I'll sell it to them.
2021-05-25T18:22:02  <LjL> Anastasius, sell me a nickname instead ;(
2021-05-25T18:23:28  <elcasey> Anastasius: why are we not already doing that since Liberia and Canonical aren't like butt-sync'd?
2021-05-25T18:23:49  <elcasey> although probably like 0.9% of us still use Ubuntu lol
2021-05-25T18:23:59  <elcasey> hey man like ... some of my EC2 instances are Ubuntu
2021-05-25T18:24:10  <LjL> yours truly, former Ubuntu group contact with freenode, uses Debian and Fedora :P
2021-05-25T18:24:25  <elcasey> actually shit I do have a lot of Ubuntu servers
2021-05-25T18:24:29  <LjL> lol
2021-05-25T18:24:32  <elcasey> lol
2021-05-25T18:24:50  <elcasey> but for work it usually ends being RHEL bleehhhhhh
2021-05-25T18:25:03  <elcasey> the more I deal with Red Hat the less I am liking them, especially post-IBM
2021-05-25T18:25:33  <LjL> ultimately i think there are nuances among distributions but there are only so many ways you can package together the same bugs so that they result in non-buggy behavior
2021-05-25T18:26:36  <LjL> i was looking for a Spotify app in GNOME Software earlier (yeah, i know...) i typed "Spotify" and it found nothing. then i typed "Spotif" and it found two things, one of them named "Spotify".
2021-05-25T18:26:49  <elcasey> and just for the record, I meant Red Hat the company, not just their Linux distro
2021-05-25T18:26:54  <elcasey> and now they dumped CentOS

2021-05-25T23:11:39  <LjL> it could, yeah
2021-05-25T23:11:46  <kevinf311-lap> whereas the freenode-policy-feedback channel is just a dumpster fire of trolling and outright gaslighting 
2021-05-25T23:11:46  <LjL> but he was seriously asking them to stop, so it's kind of... uhm

2021-05-25T23:20:02  <LjL> <alextee[m]> LjL: some channels are still neutral (#fsf and #gnu) so I wouldn't unlink freenode yet. if matrix.org ever decides to unbridge freenode, it should give at least a few months grace period
2021-05-25T23:20:03  <LjL> <LjL> freenode gave no grace period for this absurd takeover

2021-05-25T23:20:03  <LjL> <hifi> as matrix is a third party staying neutral is the correct course of action

2021-05-26T14:40:52  <lhave> We decided we had a snowball's chance in hell of buying where we were, so we thought we might as well pick up and leave.
2021-05-26T14:40:58  <lhave> Well. Buying something we *wanted* to live in.
2021-05-26T14:41:10  <lhave> That was October.

2021-05-26T18:38:52  <gav> I've never had a local team at the top of the league
2021-05-26T18:52:27  <LjL> https://imgur.com/a/ecnkgaM not sure what i think of a client doing this
2021-05-26T18:52:28  <ubnot2> Title: Imgur: The magic of the Internet (at imgur.com)
2021-05-26T18:56:58  <gav> LjL: I mean, it is accurate
2021-05-26T18:57:23  <LjL> gav, "detected" sounds like a sort of malware detection... but it's just hardcoded in the client as a "bad network"
2021-05-26T18:57:34  <LjL> i've seen this whole thing play out with Gabs on "the Fediverse"
2021-05-26T18:57:50  <LjL> people *vehemently* wanted all free software clients for the Fediverse to *disallow* connecting to Gabs
2021-05-26T18:58:05  <LjL> and when one of them, which had initially banned it, backtracked, they went berserk mode
2021-05-26T18:58:09  <LjL> i don't like that
2021-05-26T18:58:10  <gav> iunno what Gabs is
2021-05-26T18:58:27  <Anastasius> !gabs
2021-05-26T18:58:28  <ubnot2> Your analytics bitch, baby!
2021-05-26T18:58:40  <LjL> it's a right-wing instance of Mastodon (one of these Fediverse things) that got de-federated from just about every other such server because they wouldn't censor hate speech etch
2021-05-26T18:58:44  <LjL> which is fair, they can de-federate stuff
2021-05-26T18:58:56  <gav> Ah I see
2021-05-26T18:58:59  <LjL> what is not fair, imo, is demanding that MY CLIENT specifically block me from connecting to a given website
2021-05-26T18:59:32  <LjL> and they really did demand that of client, and called people (including me) fascists and nazis for saying that programs shouldn't have a blacklist (sorry, "blocklist", as blacklist is now bad) of things that shouldn't be connected to
2021-05-26T18:59:45  <LjL> otherwise, browsers should be banned unless they don't also block all "bad" sites
2021-05-26T18:59:48  <LjL> this never ends
2021-05-26T18:59:59  <LjL> Anastasius, (yes, it's also her)
2021-05-26T19:00:05  <gav> I mean, if it's a free software client, then the source code is available so that the block can be removed and the application re-packaged or re-distributed without it
2021-05-26T19:00:28  <LjL> gav, yes but is it fair or even not creepy that the people writing those clients are *mobbed* to blacklist sites?
2021-05-26T19:00:38  <LjL> when they un-blacklisted it there was a terrible backlash
2021-05-26T19:00:45  <LjL> THEY can add a blacklist to it if they want
2021-05-26T19:00:51  <LjL> its original author can do what the fuck they want
2021-05-26T19:01:00  <LjL> especially in terms of NOT adding a blacklist
2021-05-26T19:01:13  <gav> I don't disagree, but that includes ignoring demands from people to add things like that
2021-05-26T19:01:25  <gav> Ultimately if they decide to do it, that's kinda on them
2021-05-26T19:01:29  <LjL> these people wrote some horrible things about people who disagreed with them
2021-05-26T19:01:34  <LjL> including "soft" doxxing and such
2021-05-26T19:01:49  <LjL> there are people who make other people feel unsafe, on both ends of this craziness spectrum
2021-05-26T19:01:49  <gav> Then that can go to the authorities
2021-05-26T19:02:14  <gav> Also fwiw, I don't see anything like that happening with IRC clients yet (at least not as like a joke)
2021-05-26T19:02:17  <LjL> yeah, "help, police, a bunch of transgender people hate that i don't block a nazist website and they are publishing my details online"
2021-05-26T19:02:41  <LjL> gav, well, i'm just saying this Quasseldroid thing looks vaaaaguely similar, even though i don't endorse anything that freenode is doing
2021-05-26T19:02:48  <LjL> although it's not a "block" but just a warning, at this point
2021-05-26T19:03:46  <LjL> anyway, i don't know, i'm not necessarily against it
2021-05-26T19:03:54  <LjL> i'm just saying it reminds me of a thing that i had a very negative experience with
2021-05-26T19:04:07  <LjL> and if you ask anything in the F-Droid team they'll probably... not want to talk about it
2021-05-26T19:04:56  <gav> I would be more opposed if it weren't a literal description of actions taken by freenode management against certain popular channels
2021-05-26T19:05:13  <gav> Or if it actually blocked the user from connecting to freenode
2021-05-26T19:06:00  <gav> Also, it is probably doing some basic detection as well, since many people use bouncers and simply looking for the term "freenode" in the server doesn't work for that

2021-05-26T19:19:19  <elcasey> LjL: fun (for me) how we're on the same political side now, fighting hypocrisy and generally stupid horseshit behavior by a load of scum
2021-05-26T19:20:15  <LjL> elcasey, well, i'm sure we still aren't on a bunch of things, including some finer details of what you said yesterday. i'm not for 101% free speech. you could accuse me maybe of wanting "just my preferred amount" of free speech, but i think there are boundaries, and those boundaries are currently being crazily broken by both sides, in both directions
2021-05-26T19:20:21  <elcasey> of course not
2021-05-26T19:20:56  <elcasey> and no, I think you are at least fighting for sane free speech, and not cancel culture insanity and enforced ideological conformity, i.e. basic human freedom
2021-05-26T19:21:02  <elcasey> so cheers ,mate
2021-05-26T19:21:15  <elcasey> we can go back to hating each other after we win ;)

2021-05-26T19:22:16  <LjL> it's easy to hate on nazis, we've done it for 70 years
2021-05-26T19:22:24  <elcasey> easy and pointless
2021-05-26T19:22:55  <LjL> it's a lot harder to place asterisks and caveats on the things that many seemingly, to most people, well-intentioned feminists, and people against hate, and so on, say and do
2021-05-26T19:22:55  <elcasey> but I don't like hypocrisy, and obviously neither do you, and I respect that

2021-05-26T19:31:47  <elcasey> like I think I might be permanently anti-Windows because of XP
2021-05-26T19:32:44  <elcasey> UGGGHHHHH I can skip tomorrow's 0830 meeting but because it's in my BRAIN, I will wake up at 7 and so I may as well go

2021-05-26T19:34:13  <LjL> i had other choices but this won in prettiness
2021-05-26T19:34:31  <LjL> now if it 1) the radio worked including the RDS and 2) the cassette tape didn't have wow & flutter *way* out specs... :(
2021-05-26T19:34:55  <kn100> It'll be fun to repair! That's 95% of the fun
2021-05-26T19:35:30  <LjL> eh i can't do it... i replaced the radio card in the receiver since i found one for sale, and the radio became better (with the earlier card it would just not tune into things right), but still no RDS
2021-05-26T19:35:41  <LjL> and the tape deck, i have been unable to find the service manual

2021-05-26T19:36:49  <LjL> kn100, well this ebay seller was being like "why buy from me? you can buy a walkman cheaper with a broken belt, and just fix it yourself" but that was exactly why i bought from him

2021-05-26T19:38:04  <kn100> I recommend research. It's a fascinating handheld games console out of Russia
2021-05-26T19:38:57  <kn100> Way ahead of it's time, yet outdated on launch. Recommend the Xtreme model since it uses a standard USB cable rather than the classics proprietary serial cable that is impossible to find these days

2021-05-26T19:49:10  <|_ocke> what does the camera do?
2021-05-26T19:49:13  <|_ocke> can you see it on the screen?
2021-05-26T19:49:15  <LjL> |_ocke, unfortunately it has that type of rubbery plastic that gets a bit sticky

2021-05-26T19:49:22  <LjL> you can take stills
2021-05-26T19:49:27  <LjL> it has a zoom :)

2021-05-26T19:49:44  <LjL> not really, it's more or less an old webcam

2021-05-26T19:49:57  <LjL> but i think it's pretty unique in being a handheld with a camera
2021-05-26T19:50:04  <LjL> of that era
2021-05-26T19:50:07  <|_ocke> that is indeed super unique
2021-05-26T19:50:19  <LjL> |_ocke, let me see if the battery has juice and i can take a short video
2021-05-26T19:50:30  <|_ocke> i used to have an HP photosmart camera that did .3MP and it was super fancy at the time
2021-05-26T19:50:41  <|_ocke> i got it free cause i was demoing it and the photosmart printer at walmarts

2021-05-26T20:55:06  <Swift110-mobile> ok
2021-05-26T20:57:05  <edenist> witeshark2: it kind of depends which ecosystem you are invested in. They both work in similar ways, both can get very expensive. 
2021-05-26T20:59:14  <edenist> the differences depend on your specific requirements. For example, google [last time we were looking] was not able to guarantee the location of it's servers [or backups/redundant copies], which made them unsuitable for applications which had to comply with strict data privacy laws. 
2021-05-26T21:04:50  <witeshark2> edenist, hehehe... yeah makes sense

2021-05-27T13:40:50  <h00k> gav: enlighten me!
2021-05-27T13:41:19  <gav> So polymers like rubbers are basically really long chains of molecular spaghet, eh
2021-05-27T13:45:13  <gav> When you stretch the material out, it causes those long chains to align in a more regular pattern. 
2021-05-27T13:47:30  <gav> Molecular vibrations (aka heat) constantly jiggle these chains, and the jiggling combined with a system's tendency to increase in entropy causes the chains to try and arrange in a less regular, more random arrangement. 
2021-05-27T13:47:43  <gav> h00k: this causes the material to try and shrink

2021-05-27T18:09:53  <lizzie> howdy em!
2021-05-27T18:09:56  <lizzie> it's been a while, huh :o
2021-05-27T18:10:15  <lizzie> alright let's put this channel back in irssi window 11, just like old times
2021-05-27T18:12:33  <em> everything involving the crown prince of korea has been an elaborate scheme to get this channel back into your irssi window 11

2021-05-27T18:14:26  <lizzie> lol yeah I looked that up...  he was crowned by a dude from a literally century-defunct empire that is not remotely recognized as a real government anymore by any actual countries
2021-05-27T18:14:36  <lizzie> so calling him a prince just seems like it's giving him the clout he wants :P
2021-05-27T18:14:54  <lizzie> but the part about a takeover of freenode that made much of the staff and many open source projects lose trust in the network, checks out
2021-05-27T18:14:57  <lizzie> and that's what matters :P
2021-05-27T18:15:28  <lizzie> freenode having untrustworthy leadership is a problem even if it's some asshole in California who is in no way royalty xD

2021-05-27T18:17:13  <lizzie> oh wow this is getting juicer and juicier...  freenode's new leadership has connections to mtgox.  that brings back old memories (of stupidity)
2021-05-27T18:25:31  <lizzie> so what is everyone up to these days?  I've been stealing vaccines using a fake rubber arm, and then using them to get high
2021-05-27T18:26:00  <lizzie> okay, there is a possibility that I in fact didn't do that, but stole that joke from a podcast >_>
2021-05-27T18:29:49  <lizzie> oh wow now I'm seeing some claims that part of the ire towards Andrew Lee is based on him being a Trump supporter.  Well if that's so, then count me aboard the bandwagon.  Anyone fucked in the head enough to support Trump has no business running a platform for relatively-free-speech, let alone borderline communist content like open source software projects.

2021-05-27T18:43:45  <lizzie> nonetheless, I doubt it's the 14 freenode staffers' reason, but personally, I would find a Trumper being in charge to be a good reason to trust a communication service less xD

2021-05-27T18:44:27  <kn100> it's a huge rejuvenation of IRC, and loads of people new and old (including myself and old friends!) have come back!

2021-05-27T18:45:12  <lizzie> well personally, having to switch irc networks is a bit of a hassle, but at least the drama is funny I guess
2021-05-27T18:45:28  <lizzie> LjL: you mean stay on freenode?
2021-05-27T18:45:34  <NoCode> Well. I kinda care. I'm just glad another network took shape for the projects that need collabs in IRC. And also support for their users.
2021-05-27T18:45:37  <LjL> no, stay here
2021-05-27T18:45:53  <lizzie> I'm gonna stay in this channel indefinitely if things go well for me here
2021-05-27T18:46:01  <LjL> i was asking kn100
2021-05-27T18:46:02  <lizzie> if you want I can talk about the reasons I left before, in PMs
2021-05-27T18:46:03  <lizzie> ahh
2021-05-27T18:46:24  <LjL> and the questions are more for themselves to ponder on
2021-05-27T18:46:44  <LjL> like, yes, i can get that it's somewhat exciting that "stuff is going on" and people think "oh look, news about freenode! let's try again connecting to that thing i had forgotten for years"
2021-05-27T18:47:09  <LjL> but the other face of the coin is that there has been large disruption in communities and many are going to OFTC or Matrix instead of here, diluting things
2021-05-27T18:47:15  <lizzie> I'm a little confused how this is a rejuvenation of irc
2021-05-27T18:47:20  <kn100> LjL the answer to that is hopefully some time. The thing that kept me from IRC all these years is I'd set up an irssi on a server I control and then promptly forget about it
2021-05-27T18:47:20  <LjL> channels have been taken over, people have lost their nicknames
2021-05-27T18:47:30  <lizzie> most of my irc activity in the last few years hasn't been on freenode *or* libera, and is unaffected by all this noise :P
2021-05-27T18:47:34  <LjL> and that may just be for some temporary excitement that will die down
2021-05-27T18:47:47  <kn100> but now I discovered TheLounge as a client, it's no less convenient to irc from my phone as it is to use any modern chat app
2021-05-27T18:48:01  <kn100> #notsponsored
2021-05-27T18:48:03  <lizzie> freenode has largely become a place where I join support channels, and the reason I join support channels on freenode is because that's where they are :P
2021-05-27T18:48:16  <kn100> nothing wrong with irssi, it's just incompatible with how I live my life these days
2021-05-27T18:48:18  <lizzie> and if open source projects move from freenode to here, well, that's a good idea and they should
2021-05-27T18:48:27  <LjL> meanwhile #fsf and #gnu are somehow staying on freenode for now and at this time they're purely trolling platforms
2021-05-27T18:48:41  <LjL> where, while not formally taken over, rasengan (Lee) and his staff engage in such as well
2021-05-27T18:48:47  <LjL> but the other side isn't always much brighter either
2021-05-27T18:48:52  <lizzie> life has been rough since they stopped making phones with keyboards...  now there's one, from FXTec, but it's a little expensive for me until I secure a better income stream
2021-05-27T18:49:03  <lizzie> using irssi from a phone *with* a keyboard is great, but without one it sucks xD
2021-05-27T18:49:29  <LjL> i use Revolution IRC and i still hate soft keyboards but somehow have become somewhat proficient in them
2021-05-27T18:49:39  <LjL> Revolution IRC is on F-Droid and fully open source
2021-05-27T18:49:42  <kn100> yeah, lizzie if you're open to web based clients I highly recommend checking out TheLounge, it's pretty simple, but you can install it as a webapp on your phone and it works just like any other chat app you have installed then!
2021-05-27T18:49:42  <LjL> #notsponsoredeither
2021-05-27T18:50:01  <LjL> i'm not sure lizzie will be enticed by "works like a web app"
2021-05-27T18:50:04  <kn100> all you need is a server to host TheLounge on, and it's just a docker container :D
2021-05-27T18:50:09  <kn100> hahaha I am too young for this crowd
2021-05-27T18:50:28  <lizzie> lawl but don't we all love discord now, with its 200MB memory footprint for basic chat functionality? xD
2021-05-27T18:51:10  <LjL> i don't know, maybe i will try it someday
2021-05-27T18:51:17  <lizzie> wait, no, I was being sarcastic xD
2021-05-27T18:51:19  <LjL> although Element is 100MB i just noticed
2021-05-27T18:51:22  <LjL> i know
2021-05-27T18:51:33  <kn100> eh I've kind of given up on that front. If I'm forced to use slack for work, why not use something like thelounge? For me it's about what I'll actually use compared to what I think is righteous these days. I can set up an irssi somewhere, and then ssh in and access it, but I just won't
2021-05-27T18:51:42  <kn100> I just, won't
2021-05-27T18:51:56  <LjL> i connect to my znc
2021-05-27T18:51:57  <lizzie> hehe well you should use whatever irc client works for your workflow, I'm not gonna knock it
2021-05-27T18:52:07  <lizzie> and I'd much rather an actual webapp, than a fucking electron app, to be frank
2021-05-27T18:52:19  * LjL isn't even sure what the difference is ;(
2021-05-27T18:52:28  <lizzie> the electron app comes with its own web browser built in.
2021-05-27T18:52:56  <lizzie> that's why every electron app basically has a 200MB memory footprint.  Because a tiny portion of the memory cost is the actual app, and the rest is from running an extra fucking copy of chromium
2021-05-27T18:52:57  <LjL> so Element is that, but is that different from having a browser and running the webapp in it in other terms than just... that?
2021-05-27T18:53:01  <kn100> It's just a website, you use whatever browser you like, I use it in Firefox both on my phone and desktop 
2021-05-27T18:53:07  <lizzie> I already run a web browser all the time, so an additional tab costs me very little
2021-05-27T18:53:17  <kn100> Slack drives me up the damn wall
2021-05-27T18:53:26  <LjL> lizzie, well apparently Firefox was going to support "installable apps" (Progressive Web Apps?) but then they decided "no."
2021-05-27T18:53:30  <lizzie> so frankly this TheLounge thing *does* sound pretty sensible, but I don't need it because I'm already happy with irssi
2021-05-27T18:53:38  <kn100> Oh someone's posted a damn gif? Guess one of my CPU cores is now permanently at 20% until it's not visible anymore 
2021-05-27T18:53:53  <LjL> Chromium supports them, hmm what was the webapp that i just saw the other day Chromium was showing as installable but then i forgot to try it or remark it to the person i was with
2021-05-27T18:54:16  <lizzie> LjL: progressive web apps are a slightly cool idea but frankly pretty unnecessary because regular webapps already offer all the functionality as far as I can tell with the exception of offline access, and offline access to a chat program is pretty pointless
2021-05-27T18:54:27  <LjL> meanwhile i have to keep force quitting GNOME Software because it hangs up upgrading giganting flatpaks ;(
2021-05-27T18:54:38  <lizzie> oh god flatpak is fucking ass cancer

2021-05-27T18:57:15  <lizzie> and another thing that has been fairly common for a long time, is apps that run locally and then expose a web interface, so you connect to localhost on some port

2021-05-27T19:02:53  <lizzie> matrix is great
2021-05-27T19:02:59  <LjL> like Jami (former Ring), Tox, What's its name the Tor one...
2021-05-27T19:03:02  <LjL> except that work
2021-05-27T19:03:06  <kn100> I've been kind of eyeing it as something to explore, but I dunno if there's actually communities there 
2021-05-27T19:03:06  <LjL> well, Tox works, Jami sometimes works
2021-05-27T19:03:13  <LjL> but they are terrible on mobile, and i think that *could* be improved
2021-05-27T19:03:18  <LjL> kn100, there is
2021-05-27T19:03:21  <lizzie> not sure what LjL means by "totally decentralized and also totally centralized."  matrix is federated, which is a pretty good model.  Similar to the activitypub fediverse, which I recommend in general
2021-05-27T19:03:43  <lizzie> LjL: one project I've got my eye on is secure-scuttlebutt, which *is* a totally decentralized protocol.
2021-05-27T19:03:56  <em> what does it mean for it to be federated? How does Matrix make money?
2021-05-27T19:04:10  <lizzie> But what I really want is a totally decentralized network infrastructure that can still support centralized moderation.
2021-05-27T19:04:10  <LjL> kn100, F-Droid for example is a not-so-small community that just unlinked from freenode, and on freenode they have... 191 remaining users, while on Matrix that is... 945. although it's not fair to compare because with Matrix it's like everyone is on a bouncer all the time
2021-05-27T19:04:15  <kn100> so to be clear anyone can host a node in the network with their own chat rooms, and users connected to that server can connect to chat rooms on other servers right?
2021-05-27T19:04:27  <lizzie> secure-scuttlebutt doesn't support centralized moderation, but fundamentally, it could with the right plugins
2021-05-27T19:04:36  <kn100> I don't fully understand matrix and this federated stuff yet
2021-05-27T19:05:08  <lizzie> em: federated means that anyone can run a server, and the servers link up so that users of different servers can communicate with each other
2021-05-27T19:05:48  <LjL> lizzie, look IRC was created as federated. the term wasn't in vogue, but that's what it was. but then there were feuds and the federation split into two different networks, IRCNet and EFNet. the thing went on splitting. eventually a network like freenode is not federated at all, all servers belong to freenode. now on Matrix, it is *already* practically very much centralized because almost everyone is on matrix.org, and i don't see that changing any time soon. 
2021-05-27T19:05:48  <LjL> even if it did change, my opinion is that federated platforms either end up splitting on repeat, or becoming effectively centralized
2021-05-27T19:05:51  <lizzie> irc is somewhat decentralized in that different servers link up in that manner, *but* they all have to trust each other.  A rogue server on an irc network could fuck up the network, and you can't just start your own irc server and join an existing irc network without them having to place trust in you.
2021-05-27T19:06:04  <LjL> just like on bitcoin pools, there ended up being one really big one that whoops, had 51% of miners
2021-05-27T19:06:14  <LjL> in theory there can be all sorts of things, in practice people gravitate towards one
2021-05-27T19:06:19  <NoCode> Isn't IRC distributed?
2021-05-27T19:06:24  <LjL> NoCode, not really
2021-05-27T19:06:29  <NoCode> Hmmmm
2021-05-27T19:06:31  <LjL> by fully distributed i mean peer-to-peer
2021-05-27T19:06:36  <LjL> on Tox or Ring there are no "servers"
2021-05-27T19:06:39  <lizzie> LjL: irc utterly fails at federation because it lacks the security necessary to make that sustainable
2021-05-27T19:06:43  <LjL> or if you prefer, everyone is a server
2021-05-27T19:07:05  <LjL> lizzie, i'm not convinced Matrix does, although my lack of conviction today is mostly due to the IRC bridges
2021-05-27T19:07:22  <LjL> lizzie, you can read of my adventures https://paste.ee/p/NaDSj#KWtuTBAqH2puEmua5wnHLbeZ5Rnc64IT
2021-05-27T19:07:23  <ubnot2> Title: Paste.ee - View paste NaDSj (at paste.ee)
2021-05-27T19:07:38  <lizzie> irc bridges are individual things people run on individual channels, so not sure what that has to do with it, but I'll check out your paste
2021-05-27T19:07:46  <LjL> uh no they aren't
2021-05-27T19:07:57  <LjL> the vast majority of channels are bridges through the official matrix.org bridge with mostly freenode
2021-05-27T19:08:00  <LjL> bridged*
2021-05-27T19:08:07  <LjL> or were
2021-05-27T19:08:11  <LjL> until a couple days ago
2021-05-27T19:08:29  <lizzie> I don't know what to say to that since the 1 matrix channel I participate in was always bridged to espernet and not freenode.
2021-05-27T19:08:29  <LjL> if you run a bridge individually, unless you just use it for yourself and a couple friends, you'll quickly hit a K-line
2021-05-27T19:08:40  <lizzie> It sounds like you're describing a cultural issue, not a technological issue about matrix
2021-05-27T19:09:31  <lizzie> when you say k-line, do you mean that freenode banned people for operating large bridges?  isn't that, again, just a freenode problem?
2021-05-27T19:09:37  <Jeruvy> LjL wouldn't a node-based system be susceptible to sync issues?
2021-05-27T19:09:49  <LjL> no, it's something most sane IRC networks do, they don't let thousands of users join from the same IP or range
2021-05-27T19:09:59  <lizzie> matrix, being well thought out (not like xmpp), has message ids so that syncing becomes a solveable problem
2021-05-27T19:10:00  <LjL> the matrix.org-run bridge had a 25000 people I-line on freenode
2021-05-27T19:10:56  <lizzie> oh.  The matrix to irc bridge I interact with does not make a separate irc connection for each matrix-side user
2021-05-27T19:11:01  <lizzie> I can definitely see why that would be problematic
2021-05-27T19:11:03  <kn100> with matrix, would it then be true if matrix.org got blown off the face of the earth, those users could theoretically connect to other hosts, and there would be no data loss?
2021-05-27T19:11:11  <kn100> as in, the channels and stuff would still be there
2021-05-27T19:11:17  <lizzie> yes
2021-05-27T19:11:36  <LjL> lizzie, well, the one *i* am currently operating as a stopgap measure until the Libera bridge is officially ready also doesn't, but it's also been immediately hated by my channels' users, because you can't tab-complete, because it's confusing, etc
2021-05-27T19:11:39  <kn100> in that case i would personally regard it as decentralised, there's no notion of voting or PoW in it I imagine
2021-05-27T19:11:50  <LjL> even because people can't know which other people are in the room/channel potentially reading
2021-05-27T19:11:57  <LjL> one complained they couldn't ignore individual users
2021-05-27T19:12:07  <LjL> double-puppeted bridges are the only ones that work for most people
2021-05-27T19:12:14  <lizzie> that's a problem most chat bridges between different chat services have always had...  I do see why it annoys users but *shrug*
2021-05-27T19:12:44  <lizzie> I think the proper technological solution is to run a custom irc server that can create virtual users
2021-05-27T19:13:11  <LjL> as if it's not hard enough to get people to connect to two networks instead of one ;(
2021-05-27T19:13:11  <lizzie> after all, the whole point of irc is that it's a universally supported protocol, and someone with an irc client can painlessly connect it to another server.  There is no reason you need to be bridged with an existing major irc network.
2021-05-27T19:13:19  <lizzie> eh, I guess people are lazy fucks huh...
2021-05-27T19:13:36  <LjL> yes, that's totally the conclusion
2021-05-27T19:13:41  <lizzie> you could bridge to your custom irc server *and* to an existing one, but use a single connection bridge to the existing one
2021-05-27T19:13:51  <lizzie> and then when people bitch about their tab completion, tell them to connect to your ircd or go fuck themselves
2021-05-27T19:14:51  <lizzie> a long time ago I modified irssi nickcolor.pl to also colorize nicknames coming over a chat bridge, and I've been pretty happy, so *shrug*  tab completion is silly to care about, because the people on matrix aren't gonna get highlighted by you saying their name anyways
2021-05-27T19:15:11  <lizzie> brb I need food
2021-05-27T19:15:35  <Jeruvy> Good plan I need food too, but I can't decide whether to make or order
2021-05-27T19:16:23  <em> your client could create the virtual users
2021-05-27T19:16:31  <lizzie> I would also say that it would be nice for some major irc network to put in first-class support for some kind of bridge protocol, where a single chat bridge can connect to the network but keep requesting virtual usernames (maybe with some reserved prefixed namespace)
2021-05-27T19:16:59  <lizzie> em: that doesn't scale well... again, the point of irc is that many existing client softwares should work on it
2021-05-27T19:17:07  <LjL> i suspect freenode-now-Libera feels somewhat threatened by Matrix
2021-05-27T19:17:29  <waterytart> matrix is crap though
2021-05-27T19:18:42  <em> is freenode afraid of slack and discord?
2021-05-27T19:18:55  <em> or libera
2021-05-27T19:19:15  <LjL> probably to some extent
2021-05-27T19:19:22  <em> doesn't it seem like irc should get some innovations or something
2021-05-27T19:19:26  <LjL> but Matrix competes more closely since it's open source stuff

2021-05-27T19:20:17  <LjL> such as message edits and deletions

2021-05-27T19:20:39  <LjL> also replies

2021-05-27T19:21:15  <LjL> i can already see what it looks like if "my clients decide that": i just need to look at the way a Matrix room that is being used heavily *as* a Matrix room looks when bridged into an IRC client: horrible.
2021-05-27T19:21:24  <LjL> kn100, no, inline images
2021-05-27T19:21:27  <kn100> other clients have the ability to host images and link them to a chat, etc
2021-05-27T19:21:31  <LjL> em, i don't know if that's in the works but i kinda hope not
2021-05-27T19:21:49  <lizzie> back.
2021-05-27T19:21:50  <em> i mean like in discord where if you put a link in it shows youo something
2021-05-27T19:21:52  <em> like the image

2021-05-27T19:21:56  <kn100> I don't think IRC is the right base for a truly 'free' as in freedom chat destination
2021-05-27T19:21:59  <lizzie> this is a fun question, since the freenode of yesteryear wouldn't have given a shit
2021-05-27T19:22:02  <LjL> i am happy that Matrix apparently has it on its roadmap to make many of these features optional per-room (technically they will be "recommendations to clients", but then if users override them it's much easier to just ban them)
2021-05-27T19:22:07  <lizzie> freenode existed to exist, and took sponsorships to fund it
2021-05-27T19:22:12  <kn100> but I don't think anyone actually wants 'true' freedom like that.
2021-05-27T19:22:19  <lizzie> but now, freenode seems to exist as a marketing vehicle, so I suppose they *would* care about any threat to their popularity
2021-05-27T19:22:38  <NoCode> Yay falafel wrap is here
2021-05-27T19:22:40  <LjL> lizzie, he explicitly mentions Discord Whatsapp IIRC on irc.com
2021-05-27T19:22:52  <kn100> when you bring up the kinds of unsavory things that end up gravitating to truly decentralised but public chat stuff that can't be censored, the debate instantly shifts 
2021-05-27T19:22:53  <Jeruvy> kn100 I think there's a market there but nobody expects IRC to be leading the way
2021-05-27T19:23:00  <lizzie> what the fuck is irc.com?
2021-05-27T19:23:07  <Jeruvy> Perhaps it can surprise everyone 
2021-05-27T19:23:31  <LjL> lizzie, Andrew Lee's website with, presumably, his grand vision for all the IRC networks he's sneakily buying (which, for now, i think is freenode, snoonet, and rumors are maybe rizon)
2021-05-27T19:23:38  <NoCode> Time for me to go inn
2021-05-27T19:23:41  <NoCode> Too cold
2021-05-27T19:23:48  <kn100> it's definitely not discord or whatsapp. Fediverse stuff...no knowledge on them so no comment
2021-05-27T19:24:22  <lizzie> LjL: ironically this guy is probably just gonna kill off irc and encourage increased development on matrix and such :P
2021-05-27T19:24:27  <LjL> lizzie, see also https://www.irc.com/lets-take-irc-further
2021-05-27T19:24:28  <ubnot2> Title: Let's take IRC Further (at www.irc.com)
2021-05-27T19:24:28  <LjL> yeah
2021-05-27T19:24:29  <kn100> can matrix dictate what channels do and do not exist? can hosts decide which channels their users can connect to, etc?
2021-05-27T19:24:54  <LjL> lizzie, you're definitely not the first one i hear from with the take his actions amount to embrace, extend, extinguish
2021-05-27T19:24:54  <lizzie> personally I could not possibly care less what wire-protocol my chat uses, beyond the functionality it provides
2021-05-27T19:24:54  *** Lindisfarne <Lindisfarne!~l@user/lindis> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
2021-05-27T19:25:30  *** Lindisfarne <Lindisfarne!~l@user/lindis> has joined ##club-nomicon
2021-05-27T19:25:39  <LjL> lizzie, well, it matters sometimes. on IRC i can do subtle things with the text commands i know. on Matrix if i need to go beyond what Element's UI does, i need to learn... different types of things. not saying it's bad, but it's different, and that can matter.
2021-05-27T19:25:40  <lizzie> ircv3 has been a twinkle in a lot of people's eyes for a long time, and it's fucking meaningless, because what makes irc what it is is the hundreds of decades-olds softwares that support it
2021-05-27T19:26:01  <lizzie> as soon as you make a compatibility-breaking change to irc that requires new client development, then it loses any semblance of a benefit over other chat protocols like xmpp or matrix
2021-05-27T19:26:02  <LjL> lizzie, yeah well i can't deny that HexChat isn't even GTK3 yet
2021-05-27T19:26:27  <LjL> lizzie, presumably none of the IRCv3 things are compatibility-breaking as they are advertised capabilities that clients can opt in to
2021-05-27T19:26:32  <LjL> at least that's the technical part
2021-05-27T19:26:38  <LjL> then if people all starts using edits and replies and inline images...
2021-05-27T19:26:49  <LjL> but if they all do, then it means there are a few clients that support those
2021-05-27T19:26:57  <lizzie> oh god, edits?  what a fucking stupid feature
2021-05-27T19:27:02  *** witeshark2 <witeshark2!~witeshark@50-78-123-178-static.hfc.comcastbusiness.net> has joined ##club-nomicon
2021-05-27T19:27:19  <LjL> lizzie, well Matrix has it, and i thought redactions I was already somewhat uncomfortable with
2021-05-27T19:27:22  <lizzie> and inline images are a threat to irc's bandwidth-friendliness.
2021-05-27T19:27:23  <LjL> but then they added edits
2021-05-27T19:27:28  <LjL> which i'm very uncomfortable with
2021-05-27T19:27:38  <lizzie> who's gonna keep volunteering to run irc servers once they have to transfer large files around?
2021-05-27T19:27:52  <LjL> and which when bridged to IRC just fill up pages of scrollback with *one* heavily-edited long message
2021-05-27T19:28:11  <witeshark2> Insane Quiz time! Name of event -- Op Sail -- name the year IF YOU CAN!
2021-05-27T19:28:20  <LjL> lizzie, well who's gonna run Matrix servers? i still don't quite understand matrix.org/Element's commercial model
2021-05-27T19:28:37  <kn100> Honestly the limitations of IRC really do benefit it in some ways I think
2021-05-27T19:28:38  <LjL> which parts exactly are proprietary? yes Scalar, what does it provide exactly? just the silly page with the integrations?
2021-05-27T19:28:42  <lizzie> well "compatibility breaking" is a matter of practicality.  If technically an irc client can connect to ircv3, but practically the user will get a shit experience, then users aren't going to consider it compatible in a meaningful sense
2021-05-27T19:28:46  <kn100> things like *x* is typing - screw that.
2021-05-27T19:28:58  <kn100> message editing/deleting is awful and I hate it
2021-05-27T19:29:07  <|_ocke> if there is editing of already made messages, and .... is typing, then we're on fucking discord, and fuck that
2021-05-27T19:29:08  <LjL> kn100, i agree. they make it a realtime chat instead of a forum. Matrix can sometimes feel like a forum, with very long messages are replies that quote the previous message, and edits
2021-05-27T19:29:17  <LjL> these technical features *translate* into a different culture
2021-05-27T19:29:21  <kn100> they very much do
2021-05-27T19:29:46  <LjL> i don't have a huge issue with "is typing" if i can turn it off for myself
2021-05-27T19:29:52  <LjL> at least that's a chat kinda thing
2021-05-27T19:29:56  <kn100> it's very interesting to think about how the design of software encourages communities to act in a certain way
2021-05-27T19:30:11  <|_ocke> i don't know why anybody would want to see that, it's anxiety inducing, but i don't want it to show that for me, yeah
2021-05-27T19:30:18  <kn100> Telegram, as much as it is NOT a solution to any of our problems we're discussing here, does a surprisingly good job of handling huge group chats
2021-05-27T19:30:32  <LjL> |_ocke, i've (long ago) used protocols where what i was typing showed up in real time :P
2021-05-27T19:30:35  <LjL> THAT was anxiety inducing
2021-05-27T19:30:37  <LjL> af
2021-05-27T19:30:43  <|_ocke> oh god, yeah i've used a couple like that before
2021-05-27T19:30:58  <lizzie> LjL: I don't know/care "who's going to run servers."  I have my own community and if I want to use matrix, I'll run my own server.  It's definitely true that matrix has higher requirements for the server, because of its model of being designed around history-sync rather than individual-message-transport, but that also provides good functionality
2021-05-27T19:31:32  <kn100> another interesting affordance IRC is missing which leads to interesting community dynamics is the lack of shared history
2021-05-27T19:31:34  <lizzie> matrix supports federation, but that doesn't mean any particular owner of a matrix server is required to join any particular federation
2021-05-27T19:32:04  <|_ocke> really i just don't understand why we need any of the other bullshit, irc has  transmitted my text for most of my life, and URLs are text
2021-05-27T19:32:10  <|_ocke> if i want to post a pic, no big deal
2021-05-27T19:32:15  <lizzie> kn100: I agree.  typing notifications, and edits/deletions, are all stupid features.  I think LjL agrees too
2021-05-27T19:32:17  <|_ocke> i don't need it to auto-download and display
2021-05-27T19:32:23  <kn100> you can run a bouncer and therefore not miss out on history as it happens, but the fact that I can join a channel and not see everything that happened in it, and in order to maintain history for that channel I need to actively put work in - leads to an interesting dynamic
2021-05-27T19:32:24  <|_ocke> i don't want it to either
2021-05-27T19:32:42  <lizzie> autodownloading pictures is also a terrible idea
2021-05-27T19:32:45  <|_ocke> yes
2021-05-27T19:32:50  <kn100> kind of the technical equivalent of talking about someone behind their back.
2021-05-27T19:32:50  <lizzie> discord can get away with it because it's centralized and funds a big CDN
2021-05-27T19:32:52  <|_ocke> guaranteed unwanted child porn
2021-05-27T19:32:58  <lizzie> and unwanted ip address exposure
2021-05-27T19:33:01  <|_ocke> yep
2021-05-27T19:33:29  <|_ocke> and auto-joining every channel on a server with the only recourse to 'mute' the ones you don't want to be a part of is not a solution
2021-05-27T19:33:43  <lizzie> kn100: yeah well fwiw that's why matrix is designed how it is.
2021-05-27T19:33:52  <|_ocke> if my discord is in the channel where they plan a crime, it doesn't matter if i've muted it or not on a technical level
2021-05-27T19:34:36  <lizzie> my biggest problem with discord is that it's run by assholes with a history of starting companies to datamine gamers and sell all the info to advertisers.  And the technical and practical issues with discord, which are numerous, are secondary
2021-05-27T19:34:38  <witeshark2> ok ok here's a shot at a relativity comparison -- IRC (with all these issues) 0R FB???
2021-05-27T19:34:48  <|_ocke> or a more likely scenario, if i want to join a JRPG channel, i don't want to also join a bunch of porn channels
2021-05-27T19:34:49  <lizzie> and yet these days most of my chatting takes place on discord because most of my friends will only chat on discord.  le sigh...
2021-05-27T19:34:50  <witeshark2> ******Take your time*********
2021-05-27T19:35:07  <|_ocke> lol fuck facebook with a rake

2021-05-27T19:37:37  <lizzie> is google more trustworthy than discord or facebook?  oh yeah, to a huge degree imo
2021-05-27T19:37:47  <lizzie> but better than the fediverse?  what the fuck are you even talking about? xD
2021-05-27T19:37:57  <witeshark2> lizzie, ah that -- well - in my defense i DID say IRC > all
2021-05-27T19:38:14  <lizzie> witeshark2: well we're comparing apples to oranges, but going along with that, you're still wrong
2021-05-27T19:38:19  <lizzie> irc is not federated
2021-05-27T19:38:34  <witeshark2> and you something? In all this social IOT -- there is always the simple OY -- E-MAIL me
2021-05-27T19:38:45  <witeshark2> what happened to that?
2021-05-27T19:38:58  <lizzie> email doesn't scale well to multiple-user conversations
2021-05-27T19:39:08  <witeshark2> i know
2021-05-27T19:39:10  <|_ocke> email is so fuckwithable too
2021-05-27T19:39:12  * kevinf311-lap reply-all storms lizzie
2021-05-27T19:39:13  <lizzie> also email basically lacks security (there are encryption standards, but adoption is poor)
2021-05-27T19:39:16  <|_ocke> i hate dealing with email problems
2021-05-27T19:39:25  <witeshark2> but that is not NECESSARILY a bad thing
2021-05-27T19:39:43  <witeshark2> gmail
2021-05-27T19:39:53  <lizzie> witeshark2: like sorry to hammer on it, but why don't *you* make a coherent case for why the fediverse *isn't* the solution?  is it that you don't know what it is and you're embarrassed to ask?  no need to be embarrassed
2021-05-27T19:40:14  <witeshark2> no NOT at all
2021-05-27T19:40:36  <lizzie> did you just say lacking security is not necessarily a bad thing?  >_>
2021-05-27T19:41:01  <witeshark2> NO Socially intended IOT platform will **** read READ >> EVER defeat the issues that are discussed here
2021-05-27T19:41:12  <witeshark2> That is all
2021-05-27T19:41:17  <witeshark2> think about it
2021-05-27T19:41:18  <lizzie> why do you keep saying IOT?  what do those words mean to you?
2021-05-27T19:41:25  <Jeruvy> I have the perfect solution (don't hit me...) VRChat :D
2021-05-27T19:41:30  <|_ocke> hahahaha
2021-05-27T19:41:32  * lizzie hits on Jeruvy 
2021-05-27T19:41:35  <witeshark2> Internet of things
2021-05-27T19:41:43  <|_ocke> we'll all be wreck-it ralph with a giant dong
2021-05-27T19:41:48  <Jeruvy> lol
2021-05-27T19:41:48  <lizzie> yeah, IOT is like... internet-connected toasters and doorbells
2021-05-27T19:41:53  <lizzie> what does it have to do with this conversation? xD
2021-05-27T19:42:04  <witeshark2> 0.0
2021-05-27T19:42:19  <|_ocke> to be fair, lots of these IoT devices do have the ability to post to facebook
2021-05-27T19:42:25  <|_ocke> like my bluetooth water bottle
2021-05-27T19:42:26  <Jeruvy> I token based chat device that fits in a pocket ?  ;)
2021-05-27T19:42:28  <lizzie> I'm sure there's something that you mean when you say IOT, but it's not IOT
2021-05-27T19:42:36  <lizzie> so I don't really know what you're trying to say :P
2021-05-27T19:42:40  <LjL> internet of things
2021-05-27T19:42:45  <LjL> he mean a thing that does a thing using a thing in a thing
2021-05-27T19:42:55  <|_ocke> it would do it through my phone though
2021-05-27T19:42:57  <witeshark2> alright lizzie ` -- do this - define the perfect Internet Social gathering platform -- DO IT
2021-05-27T19:42:59  <lizzie> right but my laptop isn't an IOT device just because it's a "thing"
2021-05-27T19:43:44  <LjL> witeshark2, i don't think this is meant to be a challenge, just the fact that you keep using the word "IOT" for something entirely unrelated to IoT
2021-05-27T19:43:49  <|_ocke> irc has been just fine ever since i found it as a kid, problems with particular networks aren't my problem, it's the server admins problem, i just am on all the networks my friends are on
2021-05-27T19:44:33  <witeshark2> LjL, FAIR enough IOT is a typing cheat - 'nuff said
2021-05-27T19:44:40  <lizzie> witeshark2: okay. the perfect internet social gathering platform has a completely decentralized architecture, with support for servers only as datastores and bandwidth relays, has end-to-end cryptography with every user being identified by a public key, and supports creating chat communities that can be moderated by their creator(s) but that span the whole network and anyone can connect to (if 
2021-05-27T19:44:41  <em> threeeeeeeeeeee
2021-05-27T19:44:46  <lizzie> allowed)
2021-05-27T19:44:55  <em> wooos
2021-05-27T19:45:03  <kevinf311-lap> |_ocke: yeah, warts and all, IRC is the longest running "just works" social/collaborative platform i've ever used
2021-05-27T19:45:05  <lizzie> right now the closest thing I know of to what I really want is secure-scuttlebutt, which has the decentralized architecture and the users-identified-by-keys parts down pat, and is only missing the machinery for moderated communities
2021-05-27T19:45:11  <LjL> hahahaha
2021-05-27T19:45:13  <LjL> <Noir> eskimo: I think more generally, I would like to see some time between announcing a policy and enforcing it, it sets the right precedent and allows channel owners to reconsider whether to come into compliance.
2021-05-27T19:45:13  <LjL> <eskimo> Kemayo: channel exists for communication, not to act as a billboard to route you to another network.
2021-05-27T19:45:13  <LjL> <rbraun> and announcing does NOT mean "this is a draft"
2021-05-27T19:45:13  <LjL> <rbraun> it means when you decide on what to actually do
2021-05-27T19:45:16  <LjL> <eskimo> Noir: yeah, a little time before action would've been good
2021-05-27T19:45:18  <LjL> <eskimo> I can agree with that
2021-05-27T19:45:20  <LjL> (eskimo is a freenode staffer now)
2021-05-27T19:45:28  <witeshark2> kevinf311-lap, yes --- NICE
2021-05-27T19:45:28  <LjL> oh yeah a little bit of time before taking over hundreds of channels would have been good?!
2021-05-27T19:45:35  <LjL> why didn't y'all do that then?
2021-05-27T19:46:00  <lizzie> but yeah witeshark2 I wasn't trying to take the piss, I just genuinely won't know what you mean until you use terms that mean what you intend to mean.  I *do* want to understand what you were trying to say
2021-05-27T19:46:20  <lizzie> but if you ask me what my ideal is, I do have an answer and I outlined it above
2021-05-27T19:46:26  <LjL> they wrote a draft policy on github where words were subtly changes as to imply that channels that "were closed" (moving to another network) were not okay. before that github page ever actually became a freenode.net policy, they took over all single-# channels that had a topic mentioned Libera
2021-05-27T19:46:34  <Jeruvy> witeshark2 you still sailing these days?
2021-05-27T19:46:39  <LjL> and not his fuckface has the balls to say "a little time would have been good, i can agree with that"
2021-05-27T19:46:58  <witeshark2> Jeruvy, yes -- Every chance i get!
2021-05-27T19:47:01  <kevinf311-lap> took over and then *closed the channels themselves* thus violating their own policy 
2021-05-27T19:47:09  <em> eskimo at one time said on reddit that he hates open source projects. Now he's a staffer on Freenode.
2021-05-27T19:47:15  <kn100> Welp I'm convinced to check out the fediverse now!
2021-05-27T19:47:24  <Jeruvy> witeshark2 good for you!  I'm envious even though I'm scared of boats
2021-05-27T19:47:29  <witeshark2> Jeruvy, Biscayne Bay lately - around the small boat racing :D
2021-05-27T19:47:36  <lizzie> LjL: wow, it is nice to see them so thoroughly and utterly screw the pooch to make sure there is no doubt that they are completely untrustworthy
2021-05-27T19:47:46  <LjL> <eskimo> Axman6: so you don't care about your users that remain here? that don't care about the drama and prefer to stay?
2021-05-27T19:47:49  <LjL> THEY created the drama
2021-05-27T19:48:00  <LjL> the users who "prefer to stay" don't understand the fuckery that has gone on
2021-05-27T19:48:03  <LjL> or are just inertial
2021-05-27T19:48:21  <LjL> lizzie, yet, annoyingly, they still have a lot more users than libera
2021-05-27T19:48:44  <LjL> even after yesterday's extremely bold mass takeover :\
2021-05-27T19:48:45  <lizzie> witeshark2: do you get where I'm coming from?  I hope I didn't come across as hostile or nitpicky.  I just genuinely still don't know what you meant to say instead of IOT
2021-05-27T19:49:18  <witeshark2> lizzie, no worries
2021-05-27T19:49:25  <Jeruvy> so just for disclosure who here (in this chan) has a stake in libera?
2021-05-27T19:49:32  <lizzie> LjL: well when open source projects pull their own developers and core community members out of those support channels, they will become useless, and it will take a while for end users to get the message but it will be fine
2021-05-27T19:49:49  <lizzie> witeshark2: so really, can you try to clarify?  or want me to drop it :P
2021-05-27T19:49:52  <witeshark2> lizzie, you're just stating your ideas and feelings - it's fine
2021-05-27T19:50:17  <LjL> witeshark2, no, she's stating that "IoT" doesn't mean what you think it means at all
2021-05-27T19:50:25  <LjL> which is a fact, not an idea or feeling
2021-05-27T19:50:34  <witeshark2> lizzie, no need to drop it - maybe we all get new ideas form it after all ;)
2021-05-27T19:50:41  <lizzie> witeshark2: I stated what IOT means.  That's not my ideas and feelings
2021-05-27T19:50:48  <LjL> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things should hopefully clarify
2021-05-27T19:50:49  <ubnot2> Title: Internet of things - Wikipedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
2021-05-27T19:51:28  <witeshark2> well "IOT" has had many re - definitions in some articles I have been reading
2021-05-27T19:51:37  <lizzie> like if I say "I really hate software that uses quantum tunneling, like discord," and you know that discord doesn't use quantum tunneling, then you have no way of knowing what I'm really trying to say, until I clarify what I thought "quantum tunneling" meant
2021-05-27T19:51:38  <witeshark2> it's over used 
2021-05-27T19:51:44  <LjL> then don't overuse it
2021-05-27T19:51:48  <LjL> which is what you've done :P
2021-05-27T19:51:53  <Jeruvy> hehe
2021-05-27T19:52:12  <Jeruvy> Can I post that on LinkedIn LjL :)
2021-05-27T19:52:13  <kn100> I wish I could 'react' to lizzies last comment here, I'd give it a hahahaha
2021-05-27T19:52:18  <LjL> lizzie, are you *sure* quantum tunneling isn't ultimately involved?
2021-05-27T19:52:20  <witeshark2> LjL, kind of -- but no further than hat i have seen done >.>
2021-05-27T19:52:23  <LjL> Jeruvy, without my name, sure
2021-05-27T19:52:25  <kn100> that was absolutely hilarious
2021-05-27T19:52:42  <lizzie> the term IOT is used a lot, but that's because IOT products are used a lot.
2021-05-27T19:52:45  <Jeruvy> I get so much IoT crap its insane 
2021-05-27T19:53:03  <LjL> i have a smart lightbulb that is so smart it freaks out if it cannot phone home through the WAN
2021-05-27T19:53:15  <Jeruvy> All because I was talking about BadAlloc recently
2021-05-27T19:53:27  <lizzie> LjL: it sounds like your lightbulb is autistic like me, and developed an anxiety disorder!
2021-05-27T19:53:40  <LjL> lizzie, well you'd know!
2021-05-27T19:53:42  <lizzie> I knew we shouldn't have given the light bulbs consciousness
2021-05-27T19:53:44  <kn100> all my smart stuff has been rooted :D
2021-05-27T19:54:00  <kn100> yay for smart stuff that can't phone home anymore
2021-05-27T19:54:22  <LjL> i have a wifi network specifically for things like that (like my printer) that can't connect to the internet
2021-05-27T19:54:28  <LjL> i have three wifi network
2021-05-27T19:54:31  <witeshark2> alright then - ima take a fresh air walk - i had a 10 hour day today
2021-05-27T19:54:33  <witeshark2> BRB
2021-05-27T19:54:43  <lizzie> witeshark2: anyways let's circle back around, can you tell me again which issues cannot be overcome by what kind of social platforms?
2021-05-27T19:54:49  <lizzie> that's the interesting conversation here, not what IOT means
2021-05-27T19:54:51  <lizzie> oh I'm too late
2021-05-27T19:54:54  <LjL> #1 can do everything, #2 ("guest") can talk to the WAN but not the LAN, #3 ("things") can talk to the LAN but not the WAN
2021-05-27T19:55:11  <|_ocke> my WiFi SSID is 🐈
2021-05-27T19:55:25  <LjL> i won't tell you my SSID because you'll locate me :P
2021-05-27T19:55:47  <Jeruvy> LjL your profile on wigle must be interesting :)
2021-05-27T19:55:51  <Tamara> we made a conscious decision to just not get IoT anything
2021-05-27T19:55:57  <Tamara> the closest we've come is raspberry pis
2021-05-27T19:56:22  <lizzie> my phone's mobile hotspot, when I turn it on, is named FBI Surveillance Van 7
2021-05-27T19:56:37  <|_ocke> there are so many wifis called FBI surveillance van
2021-05-27T19:56:40  <Jeruvy> I keep forgetting Pi's are considered IoT...I just think of them as handy little computers for stuff
2021-05-27T19:56:47  <|_ocke> every single site survey i do sees at least one
2021-05-27T19:56:53  <lizzie> yeah, it's pretty great, I got the idea off the internet in the first place xD
2021-05-27T19:56:54  <Tamara> I mean they *are* handy little computers for stuff
2021-05-27T19:56:57  <|_ocke> and Bill Wi the Science Fi
2021-05-27T19:57:01  <lizzie> hah
2021-05-27T19:57:15  <Tamara> IoT, at least for me, is kinda defined by being an opaque proprietary mess
2021-05-27T19:57:19  <Jeruvy> |_ocke *groan* :)
2021-05-27T19:57:26  <|_ocke> yeah, it's pretty bad
2021-05-27T19:57:30  <|_ocke> also IP Freely is a common one
2021-05-27T19:57:45  <lizzie> Tamara: well that's largely true in practice, but a fully open-standard wifi-connected lightbulb would still qualify as an IOT device
2021-05-27T19:57:50  <lizzie> so hopefully your impression stops being true
2021-05-27T19:58:04  <Jeruvy> Tamara thats a great definition, I'm certainly stealing that :)
2021-05-27T19:58:24  <waterytart> howdy howdy
2021-05-27T19:58:40  <Jeruvy> howdy
2021-05-27T19:59:23  <kn100> did you know that robot vacuum cleaners still being sold by xiaomi today which are connected to the internet are actually just Ubuntu 14.04 computers?
2021-05-27T19:59:25  <kn100> with apt and everything
2021-05-27T19:59:34  <Tamara> lizzie: true yes, I'm not sure I can put my exact feelings into words
2021-05-27T19:59:45  <Jeruvy> kn100 did not know that..
2021-05-27T20:00:03  <lizzie> kn100: as much as I want to hate on that, if they are ubuntu computers that auto-update, then that puts them well ahead of most IOT crap security-wise
2021-05-27T20:00:33  <LjL> Jeruvy, but i don't knowingly have a profile on wigle...
2021-05-27T20:00:45  <kn100> they do not autoupdate
2021-05-27T20:00:51  <lizzie> okay that's totally fucked then xD
2021-05-27T20:00:51  <Jeruvy> LjL I don't think anyone does
2021-05-27T20:00:51  <kn100> at all
2021-05-27T20:01:06  <kn100> I am somewhat scared of mine
2021-05-27T20:01:23  <lizzie> well if you root it, I guess you can update it yourself at least? :P
2021-05-27T20:01:27  <kn100> it at least no longer calls back to xiaomi, and no inbound access at all to the internet for it tyvm
2021-05-27T20:02:18  <kn100> it's super limited in other ways that make doing stuff like yknow updating it much harder than it should be. It's a huge blob of a mess software wise and updating it immediately fills the puny internal storage and breaks the 'player' software they're running. Player being some open source vacuum cleaner thing I think
2021-05-27T20:02:32  <lizzie> I was gonna change my phone's wifi hotspot to some great dig at trumpers I thought of, but now I forgot it
2021-05-27T20:03:13  <lizzie> I mean I could probably make it something innocuous like "Joe Biden won the election" and still see eyes pop out of sockets with rage when people look at their phones
2021-05-27T20:04:10  <witeshark2> alright then! -- everyone here should spend a solid day SAILING
2021-05-27T20:04:17  <witeshark2> OH it's TRUE
2021-05-27T20:04:30  <lizzie> does playing Sea of Thieves count?
2021-05-27T20:04:42  <lizzie> sailing directly head-on into the wind.  fuck physics :D
2021-05-27T20:05:06  <lizzie> witeshark2: is this about you?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQeeQjdU2Bk

2021-05-27T20:05:59  <Jeruvy> old vid
2021-05-27T20:06:12  <lizzie> so?  it didn't stop being great :P
2021-05-27T20:06:20  <Jeruvy> Just sayin'
2021-05-27T20:06:36  <lizzie> I know it's old.  Rabbit's been a girl for many years now :P
2021-05-27T20:07:32  <sem> Wow it took a long time to read all that scrollback but I'm glad I did
2021-05-27T20:07:39  <lizzie> howdy!
2021-05-27T20:07:46  <sem> what an interesting conversation. Hi lizzie!
2021-05-27T20:07:57  <sem> I'm not sure if we overlapped on freenode but I was semitones there
2021-05-27T20:08:01  <lizzie> now that you're caught up, let's argue about social software!
2021-05-27T20:08:08  <lizzie> oh yeah I remember the name
2021-05-27T20:08:12  <lizzie> I don't remember much detail :P
2021-05-27T20:08:23  <sem> ok so
2021-05-27T20:08:31  <sem> taking a topical turn
2021-05-27T20:08:47  <Jeruvy> should I make mimosa's?
2021-05-27T20:09:15  <lizzie> probably?
2021-05-27T20:09:17  <sem> ever since I quit facebook I'm looking for a replacement
2021-05-27T20:09:49  <sem> where I can put real public details and organize events with people
2021-05-27T20:10:03  <sem> but the closest I got was WT.Social because everything is terrible in that sphere
2021-05-27T20:10:09  <sem> I've never heard of fediverse
2021-05-27T20:10:21  <|_ocke> meetup.com for events, but i think it costs money to be the organizer
2021-05-27T20:10:23  <lizzie> LjL: you mentioned Tox and Ring earlier, are those things you'd recommend I look into?  I found Tox on wikipedia but I can't find Ring (probably because the name is too generic)
2021-05-27T20:10:35  <sem> also -- em, were you watching a basketball game earlier???
2021-05-27T20:10:56  <sem> (last time I heard somebody say threeeeeee)
2021-05-27T20:11:21  <sem> |_ocke, yeah I've had some success with meetup, but never tried to organize anything :p
2021-05-27T20:11:25  <lizzie> sem: the idea of the fediverse is basically, lots of different communities can run their own social networking sites, but they all network together on the backend (hence "federated") so that users can read posts from users on different sites
2021-05-27T20:11:32  <LjL> lizzie, Ring has been renamed to Jami. i think you won't find them too practical, and they're both mostly focused on "IM" type (one-to-one) communication, with groups as an afterthought at best. but the *concept* is in my opinion very interesting. the other one that is somewhat similar (but more paranoid) is Briar, that i couldn't remember the name of earlier
2021-05-27T20:11:38  <witeshark2> lizzie, well ummmmm -- it was -- but you see..... my parrot threw me overboard and took the boat
2021-05-27T20:11:57  <lizzie> witeshark2: you can't trust parrots :o
2021-05-27T20:12:17  <witeshark2> anyway - should nap before work now ! lizzie i just realized that!
2021-05-27T20:12:21  <LjL> lizzie, Tox has the advantage of having a number of clients. it spawned of 4chan though so some of its developer community is... weird. Jami is now a GNU project, so completely different background, although I was annoyed that in the Google Play version of the client they included Google push notifications, shortly after becoming a GNU project. you just don't do that.
2021-05-27T20:12:29  <lizzie> witeshark2: hehe okay, I guess I'll never know what you were trying to say earlier then ;)
2021-05-27T20:12:30  <witeshark2> BBL - nap time
2021-05-27T20:12:49  *** witeshark2 <witeshark2!~witeshark@user/witeshark2> has quit IRC (Quit: all good lizzie o/)
2021-05-27T20:12:52  <sem> lizzie, sounds like if you joined a hopping IRL community you could connect to their social network, but you'd have to know people
2021-05-27T20:12:58  <sem> via that model
2021-05-27T20:13:25  <LjL> lizzie, they are both basically DHTs that tell you on what IP address to find another user, and in the case of Jami, the messages themselves can stay (encrypted) on the DHT, which helps if your client goes offline for a couple of minutes, while on Tox the nodes only help you establish a direct communication
2021-05-27T20:13:30  <lizzie> LjL: okay, thanks for the info!  and yeah, I consider IMs to just be less of a problem since, with an individual, it's easy to use almost *any* chat protocol and arrange to use some form of encryption, or whatnot.
2021-05-27T20:14:08  <LjL> lizzie, i consider it a problem that most IM platforms, including the now much-touted Signal, run on *one* server, or on a poorly federated network (XMPP)
2021-05-27T20:14:08  <lizzie> sem: nah, there are plenty that have open invitation, or that are fairly open to letting you in after some cursory checking that you don't seem like a jerk
2021-05-27T20:14:18  <sem> Also, while I think editing messages would be terrible for IRC, it is the feature of Discord that I use the most... so handy for typos...
2021-05-27T20:14:24  <LjL> lizzie, i would really like something that can't be stopped because it's a bunch of IP sharing things albeit in a secure way
2021-05-27T20:14:48  <lizzie> LjL: yeah that's a fair point.  I at least have a fair amount of trust for whisper systems, but you're right that decentralized is better
2021-05-27T20:15:06  <LjL> sem, as long as it's only used for typos, it's not a big deal. but then people use it to "rework" their messages, sometimes repeatedly, like i'd do on Reddit
2021-05-27T20:15:13  <LjL> and on Reddit it's fine, because it's another type of medium
2021-05-27T20:15:20  <lizzie> it's just not what I'm currently struggling with, I guess.  The biggest thing I'm hurting for, right now, is something with discord-like functionality but not centralized
2021-05-27T20:15:48  <|_ocke> editing messages on platforms you expect the messages to be edited on is different
2021-05-27T20:15:49  <LjL> lizzie, i am not a big fan of moxie. he stopped the ability to have the client in F-Droid because of his fixation that you must use his official binary to access the official network.
2021-05-27T20:15:52  <sem> Yeah -- like maybe if you could edit but only for 2 minutes. To keep it more like a chat and less like a (reddit) forum
2021-05-27T20:15:57  <|_ocke> irc is like stream of consciousness
2021-05-27T20:16:06  <sem> like? It IS
2021-05-27T20:16:10  <|_ocke> well, yes
2021-05-27T20:16:19  <LjL> sem, i coule even contemplate edits that must be less than say 5 characters
2021-05-27T20:16:23  <sem> I am violently agreeing :p
2021-05-27T20:16:28  <|_ocke> reading logs later doesn't even work because timing is important
2021-05-27T20:16:29  <LjL> i dunno, maybe some technical limitations done right could help
2021-05-27T20:16:41  <sem> |_ocke, I experienced that first hand just 10 minutes ago
2021-05-27T20:16:46  <lizzie> LjL: that's funny since I compile signal myself (I have a couple patches) and have no problem using the network :P
2021-05-27T20:16:49  <|_ocke> so editing for logs is also not really a useful thing
2021-05-27T20:16:53  <LjL> |_ocke, i've sometimes thought of making a thing that would replay logs to a client in real time (or sped up, but still respecting timings) :P
2021-05-27T20:17:04  <|_ocke> i have actually seen something like that before
2021-05-27T20:17:14  <|_ocke> it wasn't for IRC though, i forget what it was for
2021-05-27T20:17:15  <lizzie> LjL: there is a signal-compatible client on f-droid with different branding
2021-05-27T20:17:26  <LjL> lizzie, well yeah if you compile it yourself, he won't be able to notice. but if a group like F-Droid wants to compile it, they will have to change its name, branding, and crucially, useragent, to be legally compliant
2021-05-27T20:17:42  <sem> |_ocke, made me think of watching Twitch VODs, you get to re-experience the timing of the messages. SOmeone could write an IRC log-replayer, it's just not something anyone asked for :p
2021-05-27T20:18:10  <lizzie> sem: sorry if this is snarky, but I think the best solution to typos is to take responsibility for proofreading your message before you press enter ;)  and barring that, just send another message and correct it.  We've been doing that on irc forever.
2021-05-27T20:18:15  <LjL> lizzie, if you mean Noise, that's gone from the official repo for a long time. not sure if there's something else. the usual answer i get on the channel is "nope"
2021-05-27T20:18:18  <sem> but the point is, unlike a reddit thread which is sometimes "evergreen" content, and edited as such, with IRC, you really had to be there
2021-05-27T20:18:43  <sem> lizzie, This is why I make fewer typos on IRC
2021-05-27T20:19:06  <sem> but as an qol improvement, I prefer editing the typos because I'm not perfect
2021-05-27T20:19:23  <lizzie> LjL: I mean Silence
2021-05-27T20:19:40  <lizzie> I might be wrong about it being compatible...  I thought it was
2021-05-27T20:19:47  <LjL> lizzie, Silence just encrypts SMS
2021-05-27T20:20:10  <lizzie> ahh okay, nevermind then
2021-05-27T20:20:18  <LjL> it's a good app
2021-05-27T20:20:19  <sem> lizzie, and the fact that we've been doing it on IRC forever is the one unique part about this format!!! The fact that it just works and you can use any compatible client to connect to any network is so friggin good
2021-05-27T20:20:30  <LjL> too bad that it will now be unable to be on Google Play
2021-05-27T20:20:36  <LjL> after one of their many shitty policy changes
2021-05-27T20:20:47  <LjL> this time barring most types of apps on Play from accessing calls or SMS
2021-05-27T20:21:02  <LjL> (even though apps that do clearly ask the user for permission...)
2021-05-27T20:21:07  <lizzie> LjL: you make a good point then.  It's sad, since signal is overwhelmingly the most widely used phone messaging thing who's security I actually trust, and it has frankly fantastic adoption
2021-05-27T20:21:08  <LjL> but at least it'll still be on F-Droid
2021-05-27T20:21:30  <LjL> lizzie, mostly because after WhatsApp changed their policies, Elon Musk told people to use Signal
2021-05-27T20:21:39  <LjL> then he told people that dogecoin was cool, and it went up
2021-05-27T20:21:44  <LjL> then he said that bitcoin sucked, and it went down
2021-05-27T20:22:07  <LjL> some people have a bit too much power even when the power they're wielding is just the ability to write a tweet seen by many
2021-05-27T20:22:10  <lizzie> lawl.  Still though, if the alternative is people using whatsapp, I'm happy for them to be using signal :P
2021-05-27T20:22:16  <sem> I feel like being a celebrity must be dangerous to your health. No one could have that much power and not be affected by it
2021-05-27T20:22:19  <LjL> so i dare not think of the actual power when they actually use their money to do things
2021-05-27T20:22:19  <CoJaBo> WhatSuck sucks.
2021-05-27T20:23:03  <lizzie> whatsapp annoys me so much, but I have family in Mexico where everyone uses it >_>
2021-05-27T20:23:31  <sem> yep it has always been the standard internationally but maybe signal will cut into that slowly

2021-05-27T20:24:32  <lizzie> sadly cell phones make for particularly shitty peers in a mesh network, so what we'll need is something that's not primarly marketed for people to run on their phones
2021-05-27T20:24:59  <gav> Ohai lizzie 
2021-05-27T20:25:05  <lizzie> hiya gav!
2021-05-27T20:26:29  <gav> !gav
2021-05-27T20:26:30  <ubnot2> gav is jeans
2021-05-27T20:27:15  <waterytart> i want to replace all the cabinets in my kitchen D: 
2021-05-27T20:27:28  <lizzie> LjL: btw Jami has a Jan 2021 post about their plans for group messaging.  They literally use git, which is hilarious but not necessarily bad
2021-05-27T20:28:03  <kn100> oh gav is jeans?! I did not know that. I remember you! 
2021-05-27T20:28:12  <gav> Ofc
2021-05-27T20:28:22  <gav> !jeans is gav
2021-05-27T20:28:23  <ubnot2> gav: skookum as frig
2021-05-27T20:28:29  <gav> ^_^
2021-05-27T20:28:39  <sem> hi jeans gav!
2021-05-27T20:28:57  <LjL> lizzie, yeah the Big Issue with Jami and Tox and friends in my opinion is... that they default to turning themselves off on mobile when running on mobile data, because the battery will just die SO fast. but i think fine-tuning could go a long way to deal with that. we don't need a freaking centralized push server to make things usable.
2021-05-27T20:30:22  <LjL> i don't think these things are "marketable" if they don't work well on mobile these days
2021-05-27T20:30:33  <LjL> for many people, working well on desktop is little more than a bonus
2021-05-27T20:31:01  <lizzie> working well on mobile is important to be sure, but working well on desktop is too imo
2021-05-27T20:31:12  <kn100> I reckon self hosted stuff has some role to play in solving these problems
2021-05-27T20:31:21  <lizzie> honestly signal-desktop is a major value add for signal for me, because when I want to type long messages, I don't want to do it on a fucking touchscreen
2021-05-27T20:31:49  <lizzie> as for a push service... sadly, push fundamentally relies on cooperation with your network carrier, so it's hard to decentralize that sort of thing
2021-05-27T20:31:55  <kn100> People seem happy enough to buy iot shit, why not a box at home that can run some sort of daemon for a chat app that lives on your phone? That's probably not the solution for everyone, but maybe it is, somehow
2021-05-27T20:33:07  <sem> kn100, problem is I am not a very good sysop so all my self-hosted stuff has not turned out well
2021-05-27T20:33:12  <lizzie> sadly people are used to discord, and having their data collected and sold is an invisible cost, so it's hard to convince them to do *anything* that requires more effort
2021-05-27T20:33:23  <sem> otherwise I'd think of doing something like TheLounge for irc
2021-05-27T20:33:25  <kn100> sem, self hosting doesn't have to be self managing!
2021-05-27T20:33:45  <|_ocke> is TheLounge not already IRC?
2021-05-27T20:34:03  <kn100> The HomeAssistant people are now selling what are basically rebadged RasPis that come with a build of HASS that manages itself
2021-05-27T20:34:14  <kn100> that has its own set of concerns of course, but we're talking about average consumers here
2021-05-27T20:34:15  <sem> |_ocke, i mean I would spin one up for myself
2021-05-27T20:34:23  <LjL> lizzie, well, i have no push service on my phone because i don't have gapps, and it still gets me through the day. which is not much, but i think it's better than google seeing the metadata (and sometimes data) of every single notification i get
2021-05-27T20:34:31  <sem> but thankfully the folks at bnc4free are doing a better job of managing than I could
2021-05-27T20:34:40  <kn100> |_ocke it's just a bouncer and a client rolled into one. That's all!
2021-05-27T20:34:48  <LjL> sem, if you trust them not to read your messages...
2021-05-27T20:34:57  <|_ocke> yeah that's what i thought, i know people on irc through it
2021-05-27T20:34:57  <LjL> but then again you have to trust Libera, previously freenode, not to read your messages
2021-05-27T20:35:00  <sem> kn100, it's like quassel, but for more platforms because its a webapp
2021-05-27T20:35:06  <LjL> which *today* seems like something i don't take for granted ;(
2021-05-27T20:35:23  <|_ocke> i haven't taken that for granted since i was real young
2021-05-27T20:35:26  <lizzie> LjL: it's entirely possible to use the push service to send a completely opaque token that simply alerts an app to wake up and contact its usual service
2021-05-27T20:35:27  <kn100> I am not going to recount my love for thelounge again because I fear I'll get added to ignore lists, but I am loving it :D
2021-05-27T20:35:28  <sem> LjL, they seem pretty chill? But yeah I do have to trust them. Also trust them to not get hacked
2021-05-27T20:35:32  <|_ocke> if you want it to be actual direct, you do DCC chat
2021-05-27T20:36:04  <lizzie> LjL: and I used to use irssinotifier, which uses google's push service to send irc highlights, but with end-to-end encryption
2021-05-27T20:36:09  <LjL> lizzie, which is just a stupid workaround to a stupid "feature" of apps being put to sleep "for battery's sake" even when they are not shown to be impacting the battery in any way
2021-05-27T20:36:37  <kn100> as an owner of a huawei phone, absolutely totally fuck huawei for their approach to battery management
2021-05-27T20:36:46  <LjL> |_ocke, if you do DCC chat, you basically have to configure your router(s) for just a simple conversation these days, and it's still not encrypted
2021-05-27T20:37:15  <|_ocke> yeah, i don't actually do dcc chat, just i know that's what it takes to not go through the server
2021-05-27T20:37:17  <lizzie> LjL: I'd need more justification for your claim that always-running apps don't impact battery performance.  Android's approach to battery performance involves putting the entire cpu and network connection to sleep.
2021-05-27T20:37:29  <|_ocke> it hasn't worked for a long time
2021-05-27T20:37:45  <LjL> lizzie, well, evidently the network is awake enough to receive shit from google's push serveers
2021-05-27T20:38:01  <|_ocke> back when it worked most of the time, most people were on dialup, and their computer had the IP directly
2021-05-27T20:39:17  <lizzie> LjL: the cellular radio has its own processor, yes
2021-05-27T20:39:29  <lizzie> it can wake the actual cpu
2021-05-27T20:40:55  <lizzie> anyways I've personally noticed a rather extreme difference in battery performance, when I leave an application running that maintains a network connection and keeps the phone out of deep sleep.  Can you tell me what you're basing your claim on?
2021-05-27T20:41:08  <kn100> I don't agree with LjL that app sleep isn't a needed thing on a mobile platform, but what irritates me is on a lot of phones, even if they have an option to turn that shit off for a given app, they don't respect it
2021-05-27T20:41:36  <kn100> especially bloody Huaweis. Notoriously bad battery management. https://dontkillmyapp.com/
2021-05-27T20:41:37  <ubnot2> Title: Don’t kill my app! | Hey Android vendors, don’t kill my app! (at dontkillmyapp.com)
2021-05-27T20:41:46  <lizzie> I have literally never kept the stock firmware on one of my android phones, so I wouldn't know :P
2021-05-27T20:41:59  <kn100> I would totally root and flash stock android if I could :(
2021-05-27T20:42:11  <lizzie> if you don't have the freedom to replace the OS, don't buy the fucking hardware
2021-05-27T20:42:28  <kn100> I did have the freedom to replace the OS...the day I signed the contract for the phone
2021-05-27T20:42:44  <lizzie> I actually have a personal rule I've enforced on myself since childhood...  any computer that costs me over $100, I *must* be able to replace the operating system with an open source one, or I take a hard pass
2021-05-27T20:42:45  <kn100> and then like, two weeks later huawei yeeted the bootloader unlock code service
2021-05-27T20:42:50  <LjL> lizzie, i could paraphrase that with "if you don't have the freedom to replace the modem firmware that wakes up the CPU when google servers tell it but not when anything else does, don't buy the fucking hardware"
2021-05-27T20:42:53  <lizzie> and yes that means I don't fuck with game consoles
2021-05-27T20:43:01  <LjL> yes, that means very limited hardware. for most people, so does the OS restriction
2021-05-27T20:43:20  <kn100> and then I was stuck with this bloody phone, which is fantastic in a lot of ways, that currently has no known exploit to unlock the bootloader.
2021-05-27T20:44:07  <lizzie> LjL: the proprietary nature of cell phone radio firwmares is a catastrophic security problem for all of us, but it's also actually legally enforced by the FCC, so that's a political issue we have to solve
2021-05-27T20:44:18  <LjL> lizzie, and my "claim" is that an app that continuously gets and sends stuff to the network, like IRC, makes the battery go down pretty fast unfortunately, but for example something that tries to be conservative like Conversations, with the right mobile-friendly XEPs implemented in the server, not so much
2021-05-27T20:44:26  <kn100> really hoping that pinephone/the other open source phone projects continue and make hardware that doesn't suck
2021-05-27T20:45:07  <LjL> lizzie, there are also projects being worked on like OpenPush. they won't be as optimized as Google if those optimizations mean modem firmware tweaks. I think i will live with that.
2021-05-27T20:45:19  <LjL> kn100, pinephone isn't *so* open hardware afaik
2021-05-27T20:45:57  <lizzie> LjL: as for your claim that I am highly limited in my hardware...  no I'm not, you can absolutely replace the firmware on most phones, so it's extremely easy to avoid being trapped on the manufacturer firmware if you do basic research when buying phones
2021-05-27T20:46:21  <kn100> there's more to a phone than just the software you change out when you install lineageos
2021-05-27T20:46:37  <lizzie> the most noteable exception is if you're getting phones subsidized on contract, but, you know, don't do that.  That's a trap for other reasons, too
2021-05-27T20:46:52  <LjL> lizzie, "basic research" meaning that the only phone i found that ran official LineageOS and didn't cost two arms and two legs was a ZTE
2021-05-27T20:47:03  <LjL> and then it was dropped
2021-05-27T20:47:55  <lizzie> I never said anything about official lineageos
2021-05-27T20:48:14  <kn100> not going to go full stallman here, but Android and its consequences have been a disaster for the Freedom loving race. 
2021-05-27T20:48:17  <lizzie> supporting official lingeageos isn't about whether you can replace the firmware, it's about whether a specific company has invested development effort in your specific phone
2021-05-27T20:48:51  <kn100> Even Magisk is going away most likely.
2021-05-27T20:48:57  <lizzie> anyways, *anything* that maintains an open tcp connection is going to run your battery into the ground, even if nothing is being sent over the connection
2021-05-27T20:49:11  <CoJaBo> Android sucks.
2021-05-27T20:49:15  <CoJaBo> iOS sucks more.
2021-05-27T20:49:23  <CoJaBo> Everything is terrible D=
2021-05-27T20:49:29  <lizzie> it does seem like non-android linux phones are starting to gain traction, so there is hope
2021-05-27T20:49:56  <CoJaBo> lizzie: You can't do much with a non-android phone these days
2021-05-27T20:50:53  <lizzie> LjL: I will say, though, something that just wakes up every 5 minutes and polls for updates, can have pretty low battery impact.  It's not as realtime, but usually that's not a big deal.  If I'm out doing my thing, I don't need to be able to respond to people on discord with 20 second turnaround time
2021-05-27T20:51:04  <lizzie> so in a major sense, I agree with you that you can live without push notifications (as long as you are willing to sacrifice realtime)
2021-05-27T20:51:11  <LjL> lizzie, that's what the Matrix client on F-Droid does
2021-05-27T20:51:16  <lizzie> I am willing to sacrifice realtime, but not everyone is
2021-05-27T20:51:18  <LjL> (when it's in the background)
2021-05-27T20:51:36  <LjL> lizzie, but i think we can keep realtime with an *acceptable* battery impact, like Conversations shows
2021-05-27T20:51:58  <LjL> it doesn't mean the battery will last just as long as with Google push, but there are many compromises we make to keep shit free
2021-05-27T20:52:56  <lizzie> it achieves this how?  because if it's maintaining a tcp connection and keeping the cpu awake, there is no well in hell that has an "acceptable" battery impact
2021-05-27T20:53:49  <CoJaBo> 1% higher battery drain is hard to notice
2021-05-27T20:53:57  <lizzie> CoJaBo: what do you mean you can't do much with a non-android phone?  non-android linux phones can do phone calls and SMS, and get mobile data.  Anything else can be done on top of that
2021-05-27T20:54:07  <lizzie> yeah the difference between cpu asleep or not, is not 1%
2021-05-27T20:54:16  <lizzie> I dunno what orifice you're pulling these numbers from, but it sure ain't above the waist
2021-05-27T20:55:16  <CoJaBo> lizzie: A common issue I have when considering whether to do business with a person or company is, do I have to buy an extra phone just to run their app
2021-05-27T20:56:06  <lizzie> ...I can see why that would be an issue, but I can't see why that would be common
2021-05-27T20:56:18  <CoJaBo> lizzie: It's beoming more and more ommon :/
2021-05-27T20:56:28  <lizzie> I have yet to encounter it @_@
2021-05-27T20:56:41  <CoJaBo> I haev this happen at least once a week nowadays
2021-05-27T20:56:43  <lizzie> other than like...  pokemon go, and a few other shitty games that want me to have a non-rooted phone
2021-05-27T20:56:49  <lizzie> but I just don't play those games because they all suck anyways so who cares
2021-05-27T20:57:24  <LjL> lizzie, why does the CPU need to be awake if a TCP connection is open but nothing is actually going on on it? why can't the modem wake up the CPU only when a packet is incoming? there is the problem of keepalives, but the server party can do that. of course if carriers make google's keepalives need to happen less often than everyone else's keepalives, then google will have an edge.
2021-05-27T20:57:28  <CoJaBo> lizzie: I had to change banks when I stopped using android lol
2021-05-27T20:57:40  <CoJaBo> Cuz they don't have a website
2021-05-27T20:58:45  <lizzie> LjL: well you make a valid point about how cellular network carriers *could* work, but I don't think they actually work that way.  Plus, if you're on wifi, then there isn't a server party to do that for you
2021-05-27T20:58:46  <sem> Dang
2021-05-27T20:58:54  <sem> CoJaBo, it had an app but not a website?
2021-05-27T20:58:59  <sem> WHat kind of world do we live in
2021-05-27T20:59:22  <lizzie> LjL: I definitely 100% agree that carriers should take responsibility for finding a way to work with 3rd party push APIs other than google
2021-05-27T21:00:06  <LjL> lizzie, my old laplet's wifi (probably the new one too) has a wifi card that work in a semi-sleep mode, and wake up the system, upon receiving a magic sequence of bytes. it's a mysterious microsoft thing, but kind of interesting, as it's about what's in the packet, not who's sending it.
2021-05-27T21:00:43  <LjL> i don't suppose linux knows how to take advantage of any of that, but i read about it when i first bought it
2021-05-27T21:01:06  <lizzie> yeah that does sound like a nice idea
2021-05-27T21:01:16  <lizzie> hey this is hilarious, I was googling about this issue, and I found a thread with a post by you in it <3
2021-05-27T21:02:07  <LjL> lol
2021-05-27T21:02:09  <LjL> what did you find?
2021-05-27T21:02:15  <lizzie> https://forum.f-droid.org/t/push-notifications-without-google/6010/2
2021-05-27T21:02:18  <ubnot2> Title: Push notifications without Google - #2 by anon99929151 - F-Droid Forum (at forum.f-droid.org)
2021-05-27T21:02:32  <lizzie> anyways you won't find me disagreeing that the current state of affairs with network carriers giving special power to google, sucks
2021-05-27T21:02:54  <lizzie> I guess my point is just that, for me as a user, I'd rather get the benefit of google's push service, and just have applications be smart enough not to actually send the sensitive data in cleartext through google
2021-05-27T21:02:55  <LjL> lizzie, i'm just not wholly convinced they're given special power here aside from slightly less stringent timeouts, though
2021-05-27T21:04:06  <lizzie> then what's the alternative? nobody's gotten around to writing an implementation of some spec?
2021-05-27T21:04:21  <lizzie> "slightly less stringent timeouts" sounds annoying but suuuper minor if that's all it is
2021-05-27T21:05:49  <lizzie> well anyways, I'd like to interrupt this regularly scheduled argument for a public service announcement:
2021-05-27T21:05:54  <lizzie> who here has heard of xpra?  xpra is freaking amazing
2021-05-27T21:06:04  <lizzie> I learned about it a couple months ago and have been totally hooked
2021-05-27T21:06:07  <lizzie> it's like screen for X11
2021-05-27T21:06:18  <lizzie> well it's like ssh+screen for X11
2021-05-27T21:06:38  <lizzie> also
2021-05-27T21:06:42  <lizzie> s/alternative/problem/
2021-05-27T21:07:06  <sem> I haven't heard of it but that sounds pretty great; I honestly haven't been using computers as much as phones these days though
2021-05-27T21:07:25  <LjL> lizzie, but my distro wants me to use Wayland ;(
2021-05-27T21:07:44  <lizzie> I don't think that's a problem, as long as the *application* you want to run does support X11
2021-05-27T21:07:49  <sem> Oh! Quick question! If you had to transmit a private key from a computer to a phone, would you use Signal or some other method?
2021-05-27T21:08:56  <LjL> well i have it packaged in both Fedora and Debian so i'll try it out
2021-05-27T21:09:02  <LjL> but my GUI apps are usually all local
2021-05-27T21:09:18  <LjL> sem, i would use my wifi network and i dunno, KDE Connect :P
2021-05-27T21:09:39  <lizzie> one option is to plug it in with a cable, and copy a file to it.  is that too oldskool? :P
2021-05-27T21:09:51  <lizzie> kde connect is quite good, I should remember to actually use it
2021-05-27T21:10:25  <sem> I've either gotten lazier or my attention span is worse
2021-05-27T21:11:05  <sem> the filesystem of android is not very easy for me to understand how I can drag a file onto it, and then access the same file on the phone
2021-05-27T21:11:17  <sem> but yes I should have thought of that
2021-05-27T21:12:25  <sem> Also! On the topic of being lazy, LjL i want to tell you this but I think you'll be disappointed
2021-05-27T21:12:56  <lizzie> well the directory tree that you get on your computer can be found under /sdcard from the perspective of apps on the phone
2021-05-27T21:12:59  <sem> I prefer using the play store sometimes because it can automatically install updates, but on F-droid, you have to click "install" for each app that updates
2021-05-27T21:13:19  <lizzie> and on any remotely modern android, /sdcard is a symlink to, like, /storage/0/ or something, but I just use /sdcard out of habit
2021-05-27T21:13:33  <sem> lizzie, and that is where the confusion starts because my phone doesn't even have an sd card slot, so it never made sense to me
2021-05-27T21:13:51  <lizzie> f-droid has a device admin assistant thing you can install to automate installing apps and updates
2021-05-27T21:14:07  <sem> ooh i'd like to try that
2021-05-27T21:14:15  <lizzie> sem: yep, the symlink stuck around for compatibility with old apps and old lizzies
2021-05-27T21:14:26  <sem> last time I asked ddg it said I just had to click the button each time
2021-05-27T21:14:51  <lizzie> well *I* sure don't have to click the button each time
2021-05-27T21:15:16  <sem> I think as I've gotten to be an older sem, I have gotten worse and worse at googling
2021-05-27T21:16:30  <lizzie> sem: go into f-droid's settings, check expert mode, then look for privileged extension
2021-05-27T21:16:44  <kevinf311-lap> but also the google results of our younger years don't exist anymore
2021-05-27T21:16:54  <kevinf311-lap> i used to have such bitchin' google-fu 
2021-05-27T21:17:10  <kevinf311-lap> now it's just the same 3 sites that don't load completely or advertisements 
2021-05-27T21:17:35  <kevinf311-lap> i assume some level of ad-blocking and anti-scripting that i have prevents the sites from loading 
2021-05-27T21:17:41  <lizzie> I'm probably one of the last holdouts still running noscript.  sooo many webpages just shit all over themselves with javascript off these days
2021-05-27T21:17:57  <kevinf311-lap> i have noscript running as well
2021-05-27T21:17:58  <sem> I have a "allow repos to install/uninstall apps" but I don't see a privileged extension
2021-05-27T21:18:02  <lizzie> aw hell yeah, high five!
2021-05-27T21:18:05  <kevinf311-lap> ^5
2021-05-27T21:18:23  <lizzie> I refuse to adopt an objectively fucking stupid security model just because everyone else does
2021-05-27T21:18:33  <lizzie> if half the country wants to forgo vaccines and shit in each other's mouths, that doesn't mean I will
2021-05-27T21:18:38  <lizzie> same with javascript.
2021-05-27T21:18:43  <LjL> sem, F-Droid has a privileged extension that can automatically install things. but you need to flash your phone for that, otherwise F-Droid just doesn't have the permissions to do that without nagging you.
2021-05-27T21:19:08  <lizzie> as long as you have root access you can do it
2021-05-27T21:19:29  <LjL> now Magisk is dead too :(
2021-05-27T21:19:34  <lizzie> just gotta install the app and then move it to /system/app with one of the many apps that move other apps in and out of /system
2021-05-27T21:19:37  <LjL> or likely dead
2021-05-27T21:20:07  <sem> Ah, gotcha
2021-05-27T21:20:08  <lizzie> I lack the cultural memory of magisk, I never used it in the first place
2021-05-27T21:20:22  <lizzie> what makes it dead?
2021-05-27T21:21:40  <LjL> lizzie, his main and basically only developer was hired by Google and at first he said "oh they told me i can still work on Magisk" but then he kind of realized he was hired into the security team, and, uh, no, he can't
2021-05-27T21:21:44  <sem> I used it. But then TWRP didn't keep up with my phone, so I almost messed up an upgrade and got scared and had to restore the non-root version somehow. And that's what I use today, because the main reason I had root at the time was to make firewall rules for Spotify
2021-05-27T21:22:13  <sem> topjohnwu, we will remember your years of service
2021-05-27T21:22:40  <LjL> if a free software developer does something you don't like, just hire him to stop doing that
2021-05-27T21:26:21  <lizzie> to be fair...  if, as the open source community, we're bottlenecked on reliance on a tiny number of developers to maintain the things we rely on most, who do we really have to blame if a corporation can stop that by hiring that one guy?
2021-05-27T21:26:35  <lizzie> hypothetically speaking, of course.  I don't rely on magisk and don't really know what it does, maybe you could explain :P
2021-05-27T21:26:54  <lizzie> I kinda thought things like magisk were only needed if you want to fool applications into thinking you have a non-rooted device, or something
2021-05-27T21:26:59  <sem> I always assumed that he was the only person who understood how to do it, or else more people would have helped
2021-05-27T21:27:02  <LjL> lizzie, that bottleneck is a problem, but when we're talking about *those* corporation, if there were 20 people intently working on the project, they could easily hire all 20
2021-05-27T21:27:24  <lizzie> you can't just "easily hire all 20" unless all 20 people are willing to drop what they're doing and let you hire them
2021-05-27T21:27:40  <sem> lizzie, Magisk can hide root, but it made it really user-friendly to root your phone and keep things updated
2021-05-27T21:27:51  <kn100> Magisk was a systemless root app, effectively allowing you to be rooted while hiding that fact from the rest of your os - so you could still use apps that get mad when they are running on rooted hardware 
2021-05-27T21:28:05  <LjL> lizzie, Magisk provides "systemless root", which means it doesn't modify your actual filesystem, and it can hide root from selected apps, plus it used to be able to trick SafetyNet into passing, and also it supports "modules" and there's a ton of them including the F-Droid privilege extension installable with a tap and a reboot (and temporarily removable if wanted)
2021-05-27T21:28:31  <LjL> lizzie, give them enough money and they will
2021-05-27T21:28:47  <sem> Like I am about to install openVPN from the play store so I don't have to click every time :/
2021-05-27T21:28:49  <lizzie> yeah I'm not gonna lie...  hiding root status from apps and safetynet isn't something I consider that essential.  Though it does sound like a good convenient tool, even putting aside the arguably naughty part
2021-05-27T21:29:06  <lizzie> and don't get me wrong, I'm all for hiding root and fooling apps if you want to, but that's not something I consider to be an important freedom
2021-05-27T21:29:36  <LjL> lizzie, it is an important freedom to *me* when i'm practically forced to use government apps and banking apps that check for SafetyNet and/or root status
2021-05-27T21:29:50  <LjL> PSD2 practically enforces apps for payments in the EU
2021-05-27T21:30:00  <lizzie> well it should just be illegal for government or banking apps to check safety net and root status >_>
2021-05-27T21:30:03  <lizzie> but oh well.  *sigh*
2021-05-27T21:30:21  <LjL> yeah, we should ask that entity that can make things illegal... which one is it... oh yeah, the government
2021-05-27T21:31:10  <lizzie> gonna be blunt...  yeah, dude.  The fundamental problem here *is* your government's policy, not the technological means by which you can maybe trick them.
2021-05-27T21:31:19  <lizzie> so yes, people need to vote better
2021-05-27T21:33:54  <sem> why do they even do that. what do they care if you have a rooted phone
2021-05-27T21:35:04  <Lando-SpaceIzzle> LjL, bocchino
2021-05-27T21:35:12  <LjL> Lando-SpaceIzzle, you're almost a native
2021-05-27T21:35:59  <Lando-SpaceIzzle> Now I just need to get the hand gesture perfected
2021-05-27T21:36:21  <LjL> lizzie, there's literally no one with any seats in parliament that is against these apps, nevermind the PSD2 being an EU directive
2021-05-27T21:37:06  <LjL> SafetyNet should be widely perceived as malware
2021-05-27T21:39:05  <sem> are they against hackers or something
2021-05-27T21:39:16  <sem> do they think that if you have a rooted phone, you could modify their app and steal secrets
2021-05-27T21:39:26  <waterytart> <grisly voice> what do they got against hackers 
2021-05-27T21:39:27  <LjL> sem, they are certainly drafting legislation to effectively ban "real" e2e encryption
2021-05-27T21:39:33  <LjL> them being the EU in this case
2021-05-27T21:39:36  <lizzie> LjL: what's the PSD2?
2021-05-27T21:39:38  <sem> them are dumb
2021-05-27T21:39:42  <waterytart> wow that's really bad 
2021-05-27T21:39:45  <sem> i am against them
2021-05-27T21:39:49  <lizzie> and wow you guys are getting even dumber than my country on crypto stuff huh :P
2021-05-27T21:40:14  <lizzie> 22:39:16 < sem> do they think that if you have a rooted phone, you could modify their app and steal secrets
2021-05-27T21:40:17  <CoJaBo> lizzie: We must make math illegal
2021-05-27T21:40:30  <waterytart> or just really stupid to do 
2021-05-27T21:40:30  <lizzie> the real question is, do they think they can deploy their app to hundreds of thousands of people's phones and somehow keep the contents fucking secret :P
2021-05-27T21:40:53  <sem> well if they make it illegal /.s
2021-05-27T21:40:56  <LjL> lizzie, Payment Service Directive 2. the part that concerns me the most in this context is that it mandates that every online payment must have a second factor verification, and this 2FA must happen with a code that is somehow derived from the transaction parameters. this rules out TOTP and HOTP, which are otherwise pretty secure. so what remains is either banks sending an SMS (which is actually much less secure than TOTP, and disliked by banks due to costs), 
2021-05-27T21:40:56  <LjL> or the bank offering an app to install and you tap "Yes, I do want this payment to go through"
2021-05-27T21:41:49  <lizzie> LjL: yeah that directive sounds like it was cooked up by people who are either technologically completely ignorant, or don't care, at best
2021-05-27T21:42:04  <LjL> lizzie, most relevant article on the matter on wikipeda is  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_customer_authentication

2021-05-27T22:43:47  <pteague_laptop> i was pretty sure a lot of this was fake ... but there's now hours & hours of this & there's actually an nih paper on this ... https://odysee.com/@TruthVault:0/Magnetgatepart20-1:4

2021-05-27T22:45:42  <pteague_laptop> it's not a chip ... it's highly magnetic material put into the vaccine to help spread it if i understand the nih paper
2021-05-27T23:39:36  <moocow> which vaccine in use is supposed to be using that?
2021-05-27T23:39:55  <moocow> because the mRNA ones are just lipid nanoparticles afaik
2021-05-27T23:50:57  <gav> pteague_laptop: help I got the vaccine but I'm not Manitowoc
2021-05-27T23:51:01  <gav> *magnetic
2021-05-27T23:51:23  <gav> Anastasius: awake?
2021-05-27T23:52:37  <pteague_laptop> gav, no idea ... i'm just pointing out that the NIH has an article stating why they would be magnetic vs the conspiracy theory that they've been chipped or something
2021-05-27T23:53:35  <gav> pteague_laptop: tbh there aren't any DNA vaccines yet. The two people think about use mRNA which is a related, but completely separate molecule
2021-05-27T23:55:07  <pteague_laptop> gav, if you'd like to go down a conspiracy hole, please feel free to
2021-05-27T23:57:22  <moocow> never go down a conspiracy hole without protection
2021-05-27T23:58:32  <gav> pteague_laptop: there's no conspiracy to go down. The vaccines are safe
2021-05-27T23:59:27  <gav> Full FDA approval is likely to arrive for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines sometime within the next 1-2 months

2021-05-28T05:47:52  <lizzie> lol, there's rumors that Apple could be working on their own game console...  the same company that fights tooth and nail to make sure gaming is an absolute shit experience on macs.  I hope this is true just for the irony value
2021-05-28T05:50:53  <lizzie> pteague_laptop: if the vaccine really does have magnetized particles, then I bet sticking a magnet to the injection site is counterproductive to helping it spread xD
2021-05-28T05:52:14  <lizzie> I would still bet large sums of money that it's a hoax though.  It's not hard to stick something on your arm and claim it's a magnet, and in some of those clips they're just at an angle and balancing it on their arms with gravity...  these people are just having a laugh
2021-05-28T05:53:25  <lizzie> but I do know that autism causes playing with magnets, so this is *basically* like vaccines causing autism, right?[1~
2021-05-28T05:53:46  <lizzie> (excellent recent hbomberguy video on that topic btw)
2021-05-28T05:57:33  <Tamara> I've seen the videos of the 'magnet' shit and they're a farce
2021-05-28T05:57:58  <Tamara> put a lot of effort into making it adhere onto an arm with sweat and with the angle of the arm, drop it against the other
2021-05-28T05:58:02  <Tamara> conspiracy!!!
2021-05-28T06:02:38  <Tamara> it's all to support the claim that there's microchips in the thing which is even funnier
2021-05-28T06:05:19  <Tamara> i've got an actual chip in my hand and it's useless plus you need a "syringe" a few mm wide to insert it
2021-05-28T06:16:08  <moocow> I mean it does contain code so mayne that's why they're confused
2021-05-28T06:17:10  <h00k> Good morning
2021-05-28T06:17:33  <h00k> I'm not sure what I just walked into but I'm not gonna read the backscroll for more fun
2021-05-28T06:17:49  <Tamara> we're uncovering a vast conspiracy by bill gates
2021-05-28T06:17:53  <Tamara> or something idk
2021-05-28T06:22:29  <moocow> bill gates was too busy sicking his microchip in his employees to pull this off
2021-05-28T06:35:25  <em> The people who are worried about microchips in vaccines are getting this from places like faceook while using their phone 
2021-05-28T06:35:45  <em> so naturally they are concerned about their privacy and being tracked.

2021-05-29T13:05:22  <sem> I'm thinking about VPN stuff and nextcloud, and I'm feeling like I'm not smart enough to understand computers any more
2021-05-29T13:08:28  * cousin_luigi recommends everyone to watch "The Vast of night"
2021-05-29T13:10:05  <daftykins> sem: how-so? i run a few nextcloud instances for myself and clients, gotta love it
2021-05-29T13:11:57  <sem> daftykins, I have the VPN set up for "road warrior" access from coffeeshops, etc., so it uses 443 TCP as a fallback in case UDP is blocked
2021-05-29T13:12:42  <daftykins> ah yeah that's gonna suck :D
2021-05-29T13:13:02  <sem> so if I wanted to use nextcloud to host files, or whatever, I would have to have a solution like sslh, where multiple things can use the same port 443
2021-05-29T13:15:00  <sem> also, I'm not even sure how the DynDNS would work, like could I just go to me.dyndns.org in the browser and it would be the nextcloud?
2021-05-29T13:15:44  <daftykins> what i do for a client's instance on a home dynamic IP is CNAME files.theirdomain.tld to the dynamic DNS hostname from (in our case) noip.com to handle that
2021-05-29T13:17:23  <daftykins> recently i've moved to handling LetsEncrypt and HAproxy on my pfSense routers too, which means that i only request a wildcard certificate on the router - then any web services i want to run can utilise that for <anything>.theirdomain.tld
2021-05-29T13:17:30  <sem> There are some big holes in my background, like I'm not sure what CNAME is, but it looks like I should probably register a TLD if I get serious about setting up a home server with Internet exposure
2021-05-29T13:17:42  <daftykins> a CNAME is a DNS record
2021-05-29T13:18:21  <daftykins> well a TLD is a top level domain or domain.thinghere so you are unlikely to have your own :D a personal domain you can certainly register though yep
2021-05-29T13:18:24  <cousin_luigi> sem: Registering a TLD is quite expensive.
2021-05-29T13:18:43  <sem> heh I meant registering a website.tld sorry
2021-05-29T13:18:58  <cousin_luigi> sem: Last I heard one had to shell out $250'000 and have it approved. Still doable, in theory.
2021-05-29T13:19:22  <cousin_luigi> sem: Well, they're cheap.
2021-05-29T13:19:24  <sem> right now I have the free noip service, which gives me myplace.freedns.net basically
2021-05-29T13:19:45  <sem> yeah I just have to commit to spending like $10 a year or so? Which isn't bad
2021-05-29T13:20:08  <daftykins> yeah so say you bought sem.com - on your registrar's control panel you would create a CNAME which points e.g. nextcloud.sem.com to myplace.freedns.net
2021-05-29T13:20:30  <sem> ah cool that makes sense
2021-05-29T13:20:39  <sem> I should get sem.chat :D
2021-05-29T13:21:01  <daftykins> the standard approach is a DNS 'A' record, where nextcloud.sem.com would point to an IP,  but that's only useful when the IP is static
2021-05-29T13:21:53  <sem> then on the machine side, I would just have to setup the OpenVPN to portshare, or use sslh, so I could have VPN traffic and host nextcloud
2021-05-29T13:21:57  <cousin_luigi> sem: Three letter domains were all snapped up back in the 90s. But perhaps there's still some free on newer fancy domains.
2021-05-29T13:22:28  <cousin_luigi> sem: Just one suggestion: don't search for any on godaddy: they'll register it themselves and then have you pay through the nose.
2021-05-29T13:22:49  <sem> Good call
2021-05-29T13:23:00  <cousin_luigi> and sem.chat is already taken btw
2021-05-29T13:23:05  <sem> imposter
2021-05-29T13:23:13  <sem> sem.supplies
2021-05-29T13:23:27  <cousin_luigi> sem: How about ccTLDs?
2021-05-29T13:23:37  <sem> not sure what those are either
2021-05-29T13:23:49  <sem> oh like .co.nz
2021-05-29T13:24:04  <cousin_luigi> sem.supplies appears to be free.
2021-05-29T13:24:20  <cousin_luigi> But I'm unfamiliar with that TLD. No idea about the costs, that is.
2021-05-29T13:24:43  * daftykins has a .rocks
2021-05-29T13:24:46  <sem> maybe that's the one then :) there's a popular improv podcast that registered puppies.supplies to use for their email addresses
2021-05-29T13:24:57  <sem> oh that's good too
2021-05-29T13:25:11  <sem> ah sem.rocks is taken
2021-05-29T13:25:41  <kevinf311-lap> guess you'll have to pound.rocks then
2021-05-29T13:25:46  * kevinf311-lap runs off
2021-05-29T13:25:55  <sem> hehehehe
2021-05-29T13:26:03  <daftykins> xD
2021-05-29T13:26:16  <Anastasius> :d
2021-05-29T13:26:18  <cousin_luigi> .supplies is more expensive than regular stuff, though
2021-05-29T13:26:27  <kevinf311-lap> but really i need to pay attention to all this advice because i'm going to be attempting something similar 
2021-05-29T13:26:33  <sem> yeah I need those discount tlds
2021-05-29T13:26:44  <cousin_luigi> sem: May I ask where you are located?
2021-05-29T13:26:57  <sem> sure, I'm in the mid-atlantic USA
2021-05-29T13:27:52  <cousin_luigi> Ok, so you can't have a .eu. Those are quite cheap because nobody wants them:/
2021-05-29T13:28:02  <daftykins> xD
2021-05-29T13:28:46  <daftykins> pronouncing it is perhaps the reaction they provoke
2021-05-29T13:28:55  <sem> lolol
2021-05-29T13:29:06  <sem> that is too bad
2021-05-29T13:31:04  <daftykins> but yeah dig into the second year and nth year prices naturally, 'cause they all tout a cheap first year to lure you in, then you get a surprise
2021-05-29T13:31:08  <cousin_luigi> Yeah.
2021-05-29T13:31:27  <cousin_luigi> .cc is cheap but it's not particularly well regarded.
2021-05-29T13:31:49  <sem> what companies are you looking at to rent these?
2021-05-29T13:32:21  <sem> would browsers, etc., automatically distrust any .cc domain, or are you talking about people not trusting them
2021-05-29T13:32:25  <cousin_luigi> I'm looking on namecheap.com for the prices
2021-05-29T13:32:43  <cousin_luigi> But with random strings
2021-05-29T13:32:58  <cousin_luigi> sem: Mail servers might be wary
2021-05-29T13:33:19  <cousin_luigi> And search engine rankings would go in the shitter, but I don't know if that's your use case.
2021-05-29T13:34:27  <kevinf311-lap> i for one would like to have search engine rankings in the shitter 
2021-05-29T13:34:45  <cousin_luigi> If you really fancy a particular domain name that's taken you can see if it's listed for sale.
2021-05-29T13:35:04  <cousin_luigi> But those purchases can be expensive.
2021-05-29T13:35:08  <sem> .life looks pretty cheap
2021-05-29T13:35:23  <cousin_luigi> for the first year
2021-05-29T13:35:42  <kevinf311-lap> just like real life!
2021-05-29T13:35:52  <kevinf311-lap> well, that's not strictly true i guess
2021-05-29T13:35:56  <kevinf311-lap> pregnancy be pricey 
2021-05-29T13:36:09  <sem> mm
2021-05-29T13:36:31  <kevinf311-lap> god this old laptop is so slow
2021-05-29T13:37:05  * kevinf311-lap is poking around at the future network devices again but using a Dell Inspiron E1505 from the mid 2000s
2021-05-29T13:38:38  <sem> cousin_luigi, so where are you seeing these 2nd year prices. On namecheap?
2021-05-29T13:39:08  <cousin_luigi> sem: Yes. where it says "retail price xyz/yr"
2021-05-29T13:39:14  <cousin_luigi> Under the purchase price
2021-05-29T13:40:06  <sem> OH! Ok. Yeah I saw that, but wasn't sure if the "sales" only applied to the first year, or how long you could make the contract. I guess there's nothing stopping any of these companies from raising the price on you whenever you need to renew, since you're already using them

2021-05-29T13:41:26  <cousin_luigi> You can transfer domains.
2021-05-29T13:41:47  <cousin_luigi> The base price is set by the TLD owner.
2021-05-29T13:42:01  <cousin_luigi> Which, in most cases, means Verisign.
2021-05-29T13:42:29  <cousin_luigi> or just many, these days.
2021-05-29T13:45:11  <daftykins> namecheap has a pretty bs situation where you have to own a huge number of domains to be allowed to use their API, which is useful for tying into LetsEncrypt... i got around that eventually by just having digitalocean handle my DNS
2021-05-29T13:51:03  <cousin_luigi> How about ovh?
2021-05-29T13:51:48  <sem> yeah so the SSL situation. If I want to use HTTPS I have to pay extra lots of places?
2021-05-29T13:52:26  <moocow> can you even not use ssl any more
2021-05-29T13:55:30  <sem> looking at a lot of these, there is a price per month/year for SSL certificates
2021-05-29T13:55:40  <sem> which is in addition to the domain
2021-05-29T14:01:51  <sem> wow the .uk domain is very cheap
2021-05-29T14:01:58  <sem> probably because everyone legit is at .co.uk
2021-05-29T14:08:41  <moocow> I hhaf a .uk once for fun
2021-05-29T14:08:45  <moocow> had
2021-05-29T14:09:14  <sem> how was it? :)
2021-05-29T14:09:24  <daftykins> sem: ignore those and get a freebie via LetsEncrypt
2021-05-29T14:09:50  <sem> if I understand correctly, as long as I have shell access on the machine, I can use LetsEncrypt?
2021-05-29T14:10:12  <sem> i.e. if I am self-hosting
2021-05-29T14:10:15  <AtomicSpark> You can get a VPS for $5/mo
2021-05-29T14:10:18  <daftykins> well there are many ways to get a cert, as i mentioned i have my pfSense router fetch a wildcard one which i can then apply to any internal services
2021-05-29T14:10:25  <AtomicSpark> There's no reason to get a shared host
2021-05-29T14:10:43  <daftykins> if it's a Linux system running your web server, you can have it just fetch them too - tonnes of ways
2021-05-29T14:11:01  <AtomicSpark> Don't forget Cloudflare!
2021-05-29T14:11:21  <daftykins> heh my pal is always going on about them but i just don't see it
2021-05-29T14:12:42  <sem> My main goal for this is to host photos and backups
2021-05-29T14:13:23  <sem> which was why I thought self-hosting would be good so I can use my own disks. But maybe VPS would be smarter if you can have significant storage space
2021-05-29T14:13:28  <daftykins> what will you run it from, physical PC? VM?
2021-05-29T14:13:53  <daftykins> nah capacity costs $$$ 
2021-05-29T14:14:13  <sem> raspberry pi /me hides
2021-05-29T14:14:35  <AtomicSpark> It's to reduce static traffic and hide your IP
2021-05-29T14:15:40  <daftykins> which model? presumably with external storage also?
2021-05-29T14:17:10  <sem> yeah I have a Pi 4, and working on getting the external storage. Already have a powered USB hub on the way.
2021-05-29T14:17:34  <sem> I have a few older disks I can spin up and try
2021-05-29T14:18:25  <daftykins> ideally if the data is going to matter, you want it to be redundant
2021-05-29T14:19:45  <daftykins> (such as a minimum of a RAID 1)
2021-05-29T14:19:55  <sem> I had a nas setup at one point with Raid 0 (is that the duplication one?) inside my 2007 gaming PC, but it was too much of a power hog so I couldn't use it. I could get enclosures for those and use them with the RPI
2021-05-29T14:20:13  <sem> Maybe i'm thinking of raid 1
2021-05-29T14:20:15  <daftykins> nah 0 is the striped risk-everything one
2021-05-29T14:20:30  <sem> 0 for 0 data at the end
2021-05-29T14:20:40  <daftykins> xD
2021-05-29T14:22:01  <sem> it looks like for the wildcard certs, you need to have DNS credentials from the domain provider
2021-05-29T14:22:29  <daftykins> what type of router do you run, anything with any smarts?
2021-05-29T14:22:58  <daftykins> typically no, but there are many different ways to work with LetsEncrypt
2021-05-29T14:25:14  <daftykins> i was still pretty noobish when i was setting up my home instance, so i just have my Linux server VM requesting the cert using the 'certbot' utility 
2021-05-29T14:25:30  <sem> that is what I was looking at, hold on

2021-05-29T14:26:13  <daftykins> rather than a wildcard cert which is more restricted, you can just request the individual ones and authenticate by http challenge

2021-05-29T14:26:20  <sem> oh ok
2021-05-29T14:26:36  <sem> does the pfsense give you the power to do wildcards?
2021-05-29T14:27:03  <sem> My home router is the standard verizon one, but I have a mikrotik one behind it as a bridge
2021-05-29T14:27:08  <daftykins> it's a combination of my running my DNS with digitalocean, which lets me have a DNS API key to feed into pfSense
2021-05-29T14:28:12  <daftykins> then pfSense has an acme package which handles LetsEncrypt, meaning that when i ask it to request the wildcard certificate *.domain.tld, it authenticates by using the API access to digitalocean
2021-05-29T14:29:14  <daftykins> hmm mikrotik might do some acme stuff directly too, not sure - i recently played with some of their cheap kit but i've been having major issues at a friends art gallery where i put my first one in
2021-05-29T14:29:22  <sem> that makes sense
2021-05-29T14:29:52  <daftykins> if nextcloud is going to be the only service really, then simpler is probably better... so certbot and just requesting e.g. files.domain.tld
2021-05-29T14:30:00  <sem> i'd be happy enough requesting the individual ones, yeah
2021-05-29T14:30:14  <daftykins> *nod*
2021-05-29T14:30:47  <daftykins> i made my home one so early that i chose to do https://domain.tld/nextcloud but i prefer a subdomain now
2021-05-29T14:31:55  <daftykins> heh, the outerheaven boys are doing another multi-day Metal Gear Solid marathon - www.twitch.tv/threedogg
2021-05-29T14:34:18  <daftykins> what a bank holiday weekend, baseball... MGS and beer
2021-05-29T14:34:27  <daftykins> *clink*
2021-05-29T14:41:01  <daftykins> such hateful viewers, always sending tips to have Meryl killed xD
2021-05-29T14:44:02  <sem> I remember playing Metal Gear Solid 4 at the local pizzaria in my childhood
2021-05-29T14:44:13  <sem> and by "playing" I mean moving the joystick around during the demo over and over
2021-05-29T14:45:30  <daftykins> :D
2021-05-29T14:45:56  <daftykins> having watched them play through 2-4 a few times, i'm glad i never bothered... things get pretty nuts
2021-05-29T14:46:28  <daftykins> seems the entire deal is that Hideo Kojima wanted his minions to take over the franchise, but they all sucked so he got dragged back in each time - and he was pissed off with Konami for it
2021-05-29T14:49:44  <sem> lol maybe that explains the tone of the games
2021-05-29T14:50:14  <daftykins> seems like it :D
2021-05-29T14:55:57  <sem> daftykins, so if I registered a domain, would I need DNS access to create a subdomain?
2021-05-29T14:56:51  <daftykins> yeah you'll need the place you choose to offer DNS services in order to create the records needed
2021-05-29T14:57:24  <daftykins> alternatively, you can use the registrar's control panel to change the nameservers on your domain to someone elses, e.g. cloudflare or digitalocean who will do it for free
2021-05-29T14:59:39  <sem> Oh I didn't know that they provided free DNS services
2021-05-29T15:01:04  <daftykins> owning a domain entitles you to work with it, the nameservers set against it tell everyone out on the internet who to ask to find out where to look up that domain's DNS records
2021-05-29T15:01:40  <daftykins> most registrars offer DNS services built-in so it can seem like they are one and the same thing, but i've had clients buy domains from places that don't, before
2021-05-29T15:27:41  <sem> Ok, so let's say I have sem.itones registered. And files.sem.itones redirects to noip, which redirects to my home router, which port forwards HTTPS traffic to the Raspberry Pi running nextcloud. That much I understand
2021-05-29T15:28:13  <sem> (Cutting the $250,000 check to ICANN right now)
2021-05-29T15:28:24  <daftykins> hehe
2021-05-29T15:29:05  <sem> if I wanted to run any other server from my house, I'm not sure how I would do it. Since all 443 is getting forwarded to the server with nextcloud
2021-05-29T15:29:45  <daftykins> so web servers can handle this using virtual hosts, they can respond with a different site depending on what the request coming in is for
2021-05-29T15:30:25  <daftykins> separate systems would require a proxy on the router though to split them off, which is where i use HAproxy on pfSense
2021-05-29T15:31:23  <daftykins> i run a few simple websites from my digitalocean VPS for myself and friends
2021-05-29T15:32:19  <sem> if I had everything on the raspberry pi for now, it would use virtual hosts to make sure that the files.sem.itones traffic went to nextcloud, and the info.sem.itones traffic went to a website, etc?
2021-05-29T15:32:44  <sem> s/info/www/
2021-05-29T15:33:59  <daftykins> yep
2021-05-29T15:34:15  <daftykins> separate directories - or documentroots in /var/www/
2021-05-29T15:35:11  <daftykins> oh and be sure to avoid snaps / packages for web services like nextcloud, manual is always the best approach :D you learn more getting it going and can unpick things if they go weird
2021-05-29T15:36:58  <sem> would that extend to not putting nextcloud in a docker
2021-05-29T15:37:08  <daftykins> i don't touch container tech personally
2021-05-29T15:37:52  <daftykins> you would likely run into hassles with the host OS having the LetsEncrypt certificate and needing to give the container access to it presumably
2021-05-29T15:38:27  <sem> It's a trade off for sure; configure it manually and by the end you'll know what's going on. Use a shortcut and parts of it might start up faster, but added complexity will sink you every time
2021-05-29T15:40:53  <sem> That's cool that you made one for your friend's art gallery
2021-05-29T15:41:50  <daftykins> hang on i don't recall saying that xD
2021-05-29T15:41:54  <daftykins> oh yeah i did
2021-05-29T15:41:56  <daftykins> duh
2021-05-29T15:42:23  <daftykins> well i got a MikroTik hAP ac lite to run as a router there
2021-05-29T15:42:38  <sem> i prob misunderstood what you did lol
2021-05-29T16:25:39  <sem>  .xn--3ds443g this is a TLD?
2021-05-29T16:27:12  <kevinf311-lap> looks like someone at ICANN was doing data entry with a cat loose in the room

2021-05-29T19:12:22  <Anastasius> I was out and about earlier this afternoon and saw some house having a huge BBQ party with probably 100 people.
2021-05-29T19:12:26  <daftykins> \o/
2021-05-29T19:12:49  <daftykins> must've been a post-vaccination party :D
2021-05-29T19:12:59  <Anastasius> Yup, looked like.
2021-05-29T19:14:09  <witeshark2> Anastasius, yes - i am in my escape room hotel out of the abusive shit house and just delighted!
2021-05-29T19:14:27  <Anastasius> witeshark2: That works! :D
2021-05-29T19:14:34  <witeshark2> Yes it does!
2021-05-29T19:15:48  <Anastasius> Got the heavy mowing done an hour or so ago so now I can relax for a few days.
2021-05-29T19:17:15  <witeshark2> well then Anastasius i guess you're not in the drought range then!
2021-05-29T19:17:18  <witeshark2> cOOL!
2021-05-29T19:17:47  <Anastasius> Oh hell no, it's been raining most every day for two weeks and is supposed to do so again tomorrow and Monday.
2021-05-29T19:17:49  <daftykins> hopefully witeshark2's new digs have a fine restaurant and bar nearby
2021-05-29T19:18:43  <Anastasius> And next Sunday... wedding. Ugh.
2021-05-29T19:19:15  <daftykins> already!
2021-05-29T19:19:35  <Anastasius> Yup.
2021-05-29T19:20:41  <Anastasius> Sunday weddings are particularly boring, btw.
2021-05-29T19:25:39  <daftykins> better give the wheelie-bin a wipe down for the occasion ;)
2021-05-29T19:27:34  <Anastasius> It does need a bath but I'm probably catching a ride.
2021-05-29T19:28:33  <Anastasius> Oh, never mind.
2021-05-29T19:28:43  <Anastasius> Yeah, I won't be drinking most likely.

2021-05-29T19:31:57  <witeshark2> ok 'nough said - i should nap as i wanna have a walk about for another apartment possibility on the morrow

2021-05-29T19:34:09  <Anastasius> Don't recall anyone doing that before.
2021-05-29T19:36:34  <lizzie> Anastasius: if I ever get married I'm gonna do a prank sunday wedding, where it starts out all religious-like, but then gets interrupted by luchador Satan and he becomes the emcee or something
2021-05-29T19:36:51  <Anastasius> lol!
2021-05-29T19:41:09  <lizzie> adding that to my list of prank party ideas, along with my "gender reveal party."  If I ever have a kid, we're gonna fire the rifle at the chalk-covered block of tannerite, produce a large flesh-colored cloud, and announce "it's a fucking baby"
2021-05-29T19:43:10  <Anastasius> Just don't kill any bystanders, as seems to happen a lot nowadays.
2021-05-29T19:44:35  <lizzie> would I be a true Texan if I don't celebrate so hard somebody gets maimed?
2021-05-29T19:44:48  <lizzie> also gotta start a forest fire
2021-05-29T19:44:48  <Anastasius> You have a point. :D
2021-05-29T19:46:21  <Anastasius> lizzie: So, what's your take on all the freenode stuff?
2021-05-29T19:48:15  <lizzie> I disapprove of calling the fucker a prince, since that probably just strokes his ego
2021-05-29T19:48:21  <lizzie> other than that, fuck freenode
2021-05-29T19:48:31  <lizzie> I'll still use it for support channels though when I happen to need support with stuff
2021-05-29T19:48:35  <Anastasius> Dude's kind of an asshole.
2021-05-29T19:48:38  <lizzie> but I hope more projects move here
2021-05-29T19:49:07  <Anastasius> Oh I think they will. I shitcanned my nick over there Wednesday night, so done.
2021-05-29T19:50:36  <lizzie> to me the statistics over how many people disconnect from their servers aren't nearly as important as how many people join here.
2021-05-29T19:51:18  <Anastasius> Yeah, I just don't want any part of... whatever that's becoming.
2021-05-29T20:01:12  <lizzie> very reasonable!
2021-05-29T20:36:48  <LjL> this is what the policies, or maybe more the attitude of some of the staff about the ##-related policies, is bringing to my channel: https://paste.ee/p/0H3CH

2021-05-29T20:42:52  <Anastasius> But I'm probably overthinking things again.
2021-05-29T20:42:58  <Anastasius> NoCode: Nice drum kit, btw.
2021-05-29T20:43:36  <NoCode> thx
2021-05-29T20:47:53  <LjL> Anastasius, that's not staff, just a troll
2021-05-29T20:48:10  <LjL> Anastasius, but this is what staff's unclear policies and some of them yelling at people asking whether they can make channels leads to
2021-05-29T20:48:43  <LjL> at some point if i get enough trolls like they, maybe in #libera questioning the existence of my channel, that will be a "disturbances"
2021-05-29T20:48:53  <LjL> and ## channels are only allowed if they do not "disturb", per the policies he linked
2021-05-29T20:49:22  <Anastasius> Could be problematic going forward I suppose.
2021-05-29T20:51:39  <kevinf311-lap> would be good to get a clarifying statement that the disturbance must be ## channel directed and not just meta-disturbance about the channel except in exigent circumstances (like if someone creates a ##hitler-did-nothing-wrong for IRC nazis)
2021-05-29T20:52:15  <LjL> kevinf311-lap, but they basically state that if you aren't "able" to keep offtopic (i.e. unacceptable, disturbing) stuff under control, the your channel may not belong
2021-05-29T20:52:30  <LjL> and they also specifically state some examples of channels that "would be better suited for another network"
2021-05-29T20:52:39  <kevinf311-lap> hmm
2021-05-29T20:52:49  <LjL> emma asked about ##economics and she was yelled at, someone else asked about ##cryptocurrency and they were told this is not reddit
2021-05-29T20:53:11  <LjL> that was a particular staffer, other staffers seemed to either agree less vehemently, or to feel a bit embarrassed and saying they needed to discuss this internally
2021-05-29T20:53:25  <LjL> but meanwhile, i get this idiot in my channel, and i start wondering where this will take us
2021-05-29T20:53:43  <LjL> i don't think i'd ever seen anyone join a channel on freenode to question the validity of its existence
2021-05-29T20:54:23  <kevinf311-lap> well, the whole ubuntu-uncensored thing way back when :P
2021-05-29T20:55:19  <Anastasius> May I ask who the particular staffer was?
2021-05-29T20:57:03  <LjL> kevinf311-lap, that's different, that was in our namespace, #-channel
2021-05-29T20:57:07  <LjL> that would be still removed now
2021-05-29T20:57:17  <kevinf311-lap> fair point :)
2021-05-29T20:57:52  <Anastasius> Oh, well then I better deregister it.
2021-05-29T20:58:25  <LjL> Anastasius, i don't even know how you were allowed to register it since nowadays they have services that stop you from registering #-channels that are in someone else's namespace
2021-05-29T20:58:35  <LjL> maybe you registered it before Ubuntu filed for namespace on the new network
2021-05-29T20:59:02  <Anastasius> That I did.
2021-05-29T20:59:13  <em> It's a collectible.

2021-05-29T21:00:12  <LjL> well, anyway, i don't care about that channel, but do we kind of agree that since there is a separate ## namespace for non-projects, it shouldn't at the same time be forbidden to use it for just about anything?
2021-05-29T21:00:16  <em> then I made ##ubuntu-uncensored

2021-05-29T22:01:27  <Anastasius> sabdfl should certainly have figured that out by now.
2021-05-29T22:01:52  <sem> Rules will consolidate power in the rules-lawyers, but if you have a way to reign them in, it can stave off that eventual direction
2021-05-29T22:02:05  <LjL> Anastasius, but he's nothing's dictator since he's basically just a microsoft employee, is he?
2021-05-29T22:02:07  <daftykins> pretty sure he stepped back from Canonical and put a CEO in charge
2021-05-29T22:02:16  <Anastasius> Hello, I'm here to make stupid arbitrary decisions to piss off the userbase! It'll work, trust me!
2021-05-29T22:02:38  <sem> Idk if you can call governments a success but they have a lot of competing foci of power that at best can keep each other in check.
2021-05-29T22:02:56  <Anastasius> Yeah, I'm out of the loop as far as Ubuntu is concerned. Fortunate for me, fortunate for them. It's symbiotic.
2021-05-29T22:04:16  <sem> Here is the tldr of Ubuntu as I understand it: year of the Linux desktop will never come. Let's make phones! That's hard let's give up. Let's work on servers now

2021-05-29T22:05:59  <LjL> sem, just this stan troll for the time being, but the fire is fueled by staff
2021-05-29T22:06:43  <sem> A Foss troll? Or normal troll
2021-05-29T22:06:55  <sem> That's disappointing
2021-05-29T22:07:07  <LjL> sem, a troll that seemed to be saying that Libera policies impose that my channel must be about a FOSS topic
2021-05-29T22:07:28  <LjL> and unfortunately there is 1) wording in the policies that kind of does suggest that, and 2) staffers that have gone out of their way to suggest that
2021-05-29T22:07:42  <sem> Sounds like they're motivated against your channel's topic
2021-05-29T22:08:29  <Anastasius> sem: You forgot "let's think Unity is a good idea!"
2021-05-29T22:08:42  <sem> That was the phone part
2021-05-29T22:08:56  <LjL> sem, the staff weren't thinking about my channel. this particular troll is definitely a "COVID doesn't exist" troll, and my pastebin only covered policy-relevant stuff but he was spouting bollocks about COVID in general, you can check
2021-05-29T22:09:16  <Anastasius> Ringringringringring, Ubuntuphone (said nobody, ever)
2021-05-29T22:09:16  <daftykins> kinda funny how many projects of theirs they burnt money on, then ditched
2021-05-29T22:09:30  <LjL> but he was using the policies as a weapon against my particular channel, and with the way the policies are written, i think that's destined to repeat itself
2021-05-29T22:09:42  <sem> LjL: sorry I meant the troll was motivated, not the staff

2021-05-29T22:11:49  <LjL> this channel is just a social channel, but that counts too, but there are a number of channels about particular topics. you could link them to FOSS if you tried hard enough (anything can be linked to anything) so the policy is even more... meh
2021-05-29T22:13:07  <sem> Surely there is a distinction between allowable general interest channels, and truly offtopic channels

2021-05-29T22:15:34  <LjL> which already leavves me perplexed
2021-05-29T22:15:39  <LjL> shouldn't that be true of *all* channels?
2021-05-29T22:16:00  <LjL> but some staff have interpreted this (paraphrasing from #libera) as "we won't help you with anything in ## channels and if they create problem we may reserve the right to terminate them"
2021-05-29T22:16:22  <LjL> then you have the actual policies https://libera.chat/policies that say "Please note that groups wanting to use our network for other subjects (e.g. financial, political or dating chats) should use a network that is better suited for that kind of content."

2021-05-29T22:16:50  <daftykins> hehe, you can kind of take that to an extreme and say all of them as staff caused trouble in #freenode on freenode before their departure
2021-05-29T22:17:08  <LjL> gav, yes, then you see what jose said
2021-05-29T22:17:17  <sem> Yeah. It quickly gets in the weeds if you try to make official distinctions between the two categories based solely on the topic discussed. But from that policy it makes Jose's statements seem like a real extreme take
2021-05-29T22:17:20  <LjL> and you get how some staff interpret that
2021-05-29T22:17:23  <Anastasius> LjL: That's "no way jose"

2021-05-29T22:17:48  <LjL> let me find it... again, i have one that is suboptimal
2021-05-29T22:18:20  <sem> Basically something like ##econ doesn't have a right to be on libera and the staff would not have to keep it if they felt like the channel was causing problems
2021-05-29T22:18:53  <sem> To me this seems related to the channel that some freenode staff wanted to disband but the cabal stopped them
2021-05-29T22:19:01  <cousin_luigi> Gppd morning.
2021-05-29T22:19:13  <sem> Jose is saying they would be faster to ban channels now.
2021-05-29T22:19:23  <sem> Hi cousin_luigi 
2021-05-29T22:19:34  <cousin_luigi> Who's José?
2021-05-29T22:19:53  <gav> Does any channel have a "right" to be on Libera (or any non-government ORC network)?
2021-05-29T22:19:56  <Anastasius> Someone with a stick crammed firmly up his butthole.
2021-05-29T22:20:17  <LjL> gav, no, of course there is no "right"
2021-05-29T22:20:29  <LjL> but at the same time, if every channel left and only staff remained, they wouldn't have a greatly fun time
2021-05-29T22:20:51  <LjL> so since i've been on this network for about 16 years, despite not being staff, i think i'm entitled to be vocal about policy changes that i deem detrimental
2021-05-29T22:20:53  <gav> I believe the new freenode staff are demonstrating that
2021-05-29T22:20:57  <sem> That's how I read it any way -- if there were that channel, say, ##hitlerdidnothingwrong or w/e the staff wouldn't have to justify why they are banning it, just that it is not Foss and it is disruptive

2021-05-29T22:25:04  <sem> LjL maybe not *need*, but when it becomes more subjective? Like what if there was a pick up artists channel that bothered everyone but wasn't exactly against the law? You'd either have to make more detailed policies, or over rely on a broad one like this and subjective enforcement.... You can probably tell which one I prefer
2021-05-29T22:25:59  <LjL> sem, well, maybe i'd prefer the latter if staff didn't demonstrate that they can yell at people for asking about creating some very reasonable types of channel

2021-05-29T22:47:54  <sem> I know you said you were typing on your phone earlier, I probably should take a break from doing the same
2021-05-29T22:48:12  <LjL> sem, didn't look like anyone was paying attention
2021-05-29T22:48:34  <daftykins> g'night all \o
2021-05-29T22:48:41  <LjL> kevinf311-lap, doubtful. i brought the matter to their attention, repeatedly, as you can see on that pastebin, and their reaction was kind of ambivalent
2021-05-29T22:48:44  <sem> Nite daftykins 
2021-05-29T22:49:02  <sem> LjL: that sucks. I
2021-05-29T22:49:08  <kevinf311-lap> o/
2021-05-29T22:49:12  <kevinf311-lap> LjL: ah, i see
2021-05-29T22:49:15  <LjL> <sem> Right now we trust the staff to not act hastily but is that good enough forever  ←  i think this would be a pretty good time for staff to show they *don't* act arbitrarily like the new freenode staff
2021-05-29T22:49:20  <sem> Hope the troll gets bored
2021-05-29T22:49:41  <sem> LjL: right
2021-05-29T22:49:48  <LjL> sem, i banned the troll :P not immediately, but after a whole lot of "covid doesn't exist" shit
2021-05-29T22:50:06  <sem> Good to let them build their own case against themselves
2021-05-29T22:51:24  <em> amdj saying what he said about being in a channel is not an endoresment is directly becaues of something i said to him in pm earlier that day.
2021-05-29T22:51:48  <em> Also i was talking to him about #math before I talked to "no way" Jose.
2021-05-29T22:52:29  <LjL> i also brought ##English as an example. it's a well-known channel, it has zero to do with FOSS unless you make very indirect reasonings, and it would be absurd to see it go
2021-05-29T22:52:29  <em> And everyone agreed that would be an okay channel here and it would be crazy to expect 'the chairman of math' to come forward to fill out paperwork to register that channel 
2021-05-29T22:53:01  <em> I mean this was how he himself was talking on the same day that jose was saying those kinds of channels have no place here.
2021-05-29T22:53:08  <LjL> but they have "community channels" now, so #math can conceivably be registered as such if it's considered directly relevant to FOSS, even though it's single-#
2021-05-29T22:53:09  <em> and that was #math with one #.
2021-05-29T22:53:26  <em> but #math is not more related to foss than #economics is.
2021-05-29T22:53:31  <em> or #coffee if you ask me.
2021-05-29T22:53:53  <em> The entire thing is really silly and unncessary.
2021-05-29T22:54:00  <LjL> yeah, it's vague. and i don't think this change about single-# channels was sane to bring forward just as the migration happened
2021-05-29T22:54:11  <LjL> jess told me it was "now or never", because you can't change these things afterwards
2021-05-29T22:54:16  <LjL> i think you kinda can, but even if you can't
2021-05-29T22:54:26  <LjL> we were all preoccupied with getting our nicks and channels before someone else did
2021-05-29T22:54:27  <sem> Something like math is more of a gray area than coffee, hopefully
2021-05-29T22:54:36  <LjL> i don't think they needed to add more complications
2021-05-29T22:54:42  <LjL> hehe
2021-05-29T22:55:01  <LjL> coffee is obviously strictly related to coding
2021-05-29T22:55:02  <em> this is an example of what I said before about how these people are stubborn in a way like i've never seen any other group of people. It has the look and feel of people who are making things up as they go but ALWAYS playing it after the fact as if you were ridiculous for ever having wondered after one of them stumbles into a corner and the rest of them have to pretend that's always been the rule.
2021-05-29T22:56:29  <sem> I just want to give them the benefit of the doubt and hope they don't do anything actually bad like ban ##gardening 
2021-05-29T22:56:54  <Anastasius> They're just control freaks with no lives. End of story.
2021-05-29T22:57:03  <Anastasius> Always have been, always will be.
2021-05-29T22:57:26  <LjL> why you talking about me now?
2021-05-29T22:57:28  <Anastasius> So mockery should be a thing, but it's not tolerable. Apparently.
2021-05-29T22:58:46  <LjL> sleep is now required
2021-05-29T22:58:53  <sem> Have you ever seen or heard IRC mentioned in the popular media?
2021-05-29T22:59:11  <Anastasius> No. That's the interesting part. 
2021-05-29T22:59:15  <Anastasius> I mean aside from...
2021-05-29T22:59:18  <LjL> "IRC is where hackers hang out when they don't want to be overheard"
2021-05-29T22:59:19  <Anastasius> Iirc
2021-05-29T22:59:21  <kevinf311-lap> ^

2021-05-29T22:59:31  <Anastasius> Iirc
2021-05-29T22:59:44  <Anastasius> Perhaps that factoid did not carry over.
2021-05-29T22:59:47  <sem> Lol was that numb3rs lolol I remember that
2021-05-29T22:59:52  <LjL> !irc
2021-05-29T22:59:53  <ubnot2> Internet Relay Chat, it's how hackers talk when they don't want to be overheard http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2rGTXHvPCQ  also see !ssl.
2021-05-29T23:00:04  <LjL> Anastasius, try an actual exclamation mark
2021-05-29T23:00:06  <LjL> I isn't one
2021-05-29T23:00:14  <sem> IRC is like two ships passing in the ocean at night
2021-05-29T23:00:20  <Anastasius> LjL: Sorry, I've had a few beers over here.
2021-05-29T23:00:37  <LjL> i haven't had my dose of limoncello and i miss it :(
2021-05-29T23:00:43  <LjL> supermarket was out this week
2021-05-29T23:00:48  <kevinf311-lap> perhaps i will pour a scotch 
2021-05-29T23:01:11  <LjL> i will go to sleep and wake up tomorrow (well, today), with the knowledge that it will be a worse day
2021-05-29T23:01:28  <Anastasius> Boozemeister.
2021-05-29T23:01:30  <kevinf311-lap> i hope at least the sleep is nice then LjL!
2021-05-29T23:01:52  <LjL> any time unconscious is nicer than the rest
2021-05-29T23:01:53  <Anastasius> Let's get a screenshot.
2021-05-29T23:02:43  <sem> Anastasius: such a relief they got it before the window closed
2021-05-29T23:02:56  <Anastasius> sem: Yes, quite.
2021-05-29T23:03:20  <sem> I can't I'm dying
2021-05-29T23:03:46  <sem> Goodnight y'all
2021-05-29T23:03:53  <Anastasius> Yet another example where TV does not reflect reality.
2021-05-29T23:05:06  <cousin_luigi> People watch TV?
2021-05-29T23:06:02  <Anastasius> Yes.
2021-05-29T23:07:19  <kevinf311-lap> i decided to go with rye instead
2021-05-29T23:07:51  <cousin_luigi> Anastasius: Non old people?
2021-05-29T23:07:56  <kevinf311-lap> oh Anastasius, speaking of TV; the Comet X-Files marathon does not advance the weekly episodes, it's made up of already aired (on comet) episodes

2021-05-29T23:08:43  <kevinf311-lap> Monday at 10am eastern for 15hrs i think
2021-05-29T23:09:08  <Anastasius> kevinf311-lap: Oh cool. I need to check the schedule. I don't suppose "Home" will be there.

2021-05-29T23:11:01  <Anastasius> kevinf311-lap: Shit, that looks like a pretty good marathon lineup, many of which I've missed lately.
2021-05-29T23:11:12  <kevinf311-lap> we have this place called Total Wine and More (a chain, national) that is more or less the WalMart of alcohol 
2021-05-29T23:11:47  <kevinf311-lap> since covid I've been selecting items via their app, then picking up in the parking lot
2021-05-29T23:12:13  <kevinf311-lap> was doing about 2month stocks at a time but recently that has started to last me closer to 3mo at a time 
2021-05-29T23:12:31  <kevinf311-lap> seemed to start stretching farther after, i dunno, late January :P
2021-05-29T23:13:06  * cousin_luigi drinks so little that his booze ends up spoiling
2021-05-29T23:13:15  <cousin_luigi> Perhaps I should invite more people over?
2021-05-29T23:13:26  <kevinf311-lap> i definitely need to start hosting folks again
2021-05-29T23:13:30  <em> invite me over
2021-05-29T23:14:16  <kevinf311-lap> most of my stuff sits on the standing bar; the only things i actually cycle through are beer and wine with dinner and various brown liquors slowly throughout the year 
2021-05-29T23:15:13  <Anastasius> You should see elcasey's new wine rack scenario.
2021-05-29T23:15:24  <kevinf311-lap> yeah? in his new abode?
2021-05-29T23:15:25  <Anastasius> It's kind of not half bad.
2021-05-29T23:15:27  <Anastasius> Yup.
2021-05-29T23:15:39  <kevinf311-lap> i'll have to ping him about it next time we overlap 
2021-05-29T23:16:03  <Anastasius> Yeah ask. Looks like a really nice house he's bought into.
2021-05-29T23:16:07  <kevinf311-lap> i need to sort out the humidity/moisture issue in the crawlspace before i get a fancy wine rack setup 
2021-05-29T23:16:25  <kevinf311-lap> yeah! i saw some pictures a while back of the empty house (if that's still the same place)
2021-05-29T23:17:25  <Anastasius> He seems happier than he's been in a loooong time, so that's good.
2021-05-29T23:17:47  <kevinf311-lap> that is good; he's one of my oldest irc contacts 
2021-05-29T23:18:25  <Anastasius> Especially now that he doesn't have to fly back and forth to MA on a weekly basis any longer. :D
2021-05-29T23:18:46  <kevinf311-lap> yeah that's gotta help

2021-05-29T23:33:20  <NoCode> Yes
2021-05-29T23:33:49  <NoCode> When I got them setup. I tried them then ran to the music store to get new batter heads.
2021-05-29T23:34:33  <NoCode> From 3-4 I was tuning them. I just got the last drum tuned.
2021-05-29T23:35:00  <NoCode> The guy I bought them from: "Oh yeah they're tuned! I just tuned them!"
2021-05-29T23:35:04  <NoCode> well fucking shit
2021-05-29T23:35:18  <NoCode> YOU DID NOT AND IF YOU DID, YOU NEED SOME EARS BUDDY!

2021-05-29T23:35:53  <NoCode> I got Remo pinstripe
2021-05-29T23:36:04  <NoCode> and an ambassador snare head
2021-05-29T23:36:19  <NoCode> tuned both batter and reso heads
2021-05-29T23:36:50  <NoCode> Now tomorrow I can play around more. But I'm pretty sure I need the high tom tuned higher
2021-05-29T23:37:11  <NoCode> So I had played them between changing heads

2021-05-30T00:07:54  <kevinf311-lap> this netgear manual is written in a very tautological way
2021-05-30T00:08:24  <kevinf311-lap> "Private VLAN Host. Sets the interface in host mode, which is used for private VLAN host interface configurations"
2021-05-30T00:08:49  <kevinf311-lap> this is like in grade school where you got points off for using the word in the definition

2021-05-30T00:09:55  <Anastasius> Technical writers need more instruction in writing to the general public.

2021-05-30T18:37:57  <LjL> daftykins, best to ask the president of the united states for a stamp of approval *rolleyes*

2021-05-30T18:38:15  <NoCode> Yeah, but he shouldn't be doing that with namespaces for projects.
2021-05-30T18:38:42  <NoCode> I hope that lands poor influence on any other decision he has for the future of his bullshit.
2021-05-30T18:39:37  <sem> last i saw in #freenode they were telling people to keep libera out of /topic, but having it in a chanserv entrymsg was ok? seems so random

2021-05-30T18:42:58  <LjL> sem, are you sure it wasn't just because someone thought "hey they are scanning topics with something automated but they aren't scanning entrymsgs, so you can use that for now"?
2021-05-30T18:43:20  <sem> it was a staff explaining the rules iirc
2021-05-30T18:43:52  <daftykins> LjL: i don't know what you meant by that POTUS reference!
2021-05-30T18:43:55  <sem> [eskimo] pavonia: it's not the linking to another network part, it's the locking and abandoning channels part
2021-05-30T18:43:55  <sem> <ob> [eskimo] pavonia: yes, and now, we don't really recommend that kinda stuff in the topic, but rather use the chanserv ENTRYMSG or a bot to announce that you're alson on x,y,z networks
2021-05-30T18:44:42  <LjL> daftykins, i just mean i think channels should see it very much as a no-brainer that Andrew Lee is not a respectable individual, especially after the forced takeover of most project channels (notwithstanding his "apology" page, lolk), and not waste so much time in meetings and bureaucracy, and just move
2021-05-30T18:45:02  <daftykins> mmm, i've been shocked by a couple of guys in there who want to stay put
2021-05-30T18:45:10  <daftykins> they keep defending freenode's actions
2021-05-30T18:45:11  <sem> looks like irssi decided to stay with freenode?

2021-05-30T18:45:57  <sem> oh you are in ##freenode as well
2021-05-30T18:46:02  <kevinf311-lap> was there actually much +m on channels moving prior to the sweep? anecdotally none of the channels I was in on freenode went +m because they were moving, it was all open decision 
2021-05-30T18:46:03  <LjL> yeah but i didn't click on the commit
2021-05-30T18:46:37  <LjL> kevinf311-lap, i don't know, but the channel i managed which was taken over wasn't +m at all, it simply had "Libera" in the topic, as a "MAY move", not even a "HAS moved"
2021-05-30T18:46:43  <LjL> it was absolutely preposterous
2021-05-30T18:46:45  <kevinf311-lap> likewise 
2021-05-30T18:46:59  <sem> just a shoddy lie/justification
2021-05-30T18:46:59  <kevinf311-lap> it was the freenodecom bot that +m'd the channels 
2021-05-30T18:46:59  <LjL> i wasn't even the channel's founder, i just had the ability to set a topic
2021-05-30T18:47:05  <LjL> yeah
2021-05-30T18:47:10  <sem> maybe 1 channel did it, but not very many it seems
2021-05-30T18:47:11  <kevinf311-lap> i figured it was gaslighting 
2021-05-30T18:47:30  <kevinf311-lap> but i only had knowledge of the channels i was in, which were admittedly all mostly social 
2021-05-30T18:47:37  <LjL> but does it matter?
2021-05-30T18:47:58  <LjL> 1) freenode always had a policy of giving a grace period of channels moving to another network, so that they could set +m and set a topic and messages indicating the move
2021-05-30T18:48:04  <kevinf311-lap> i would like to have an accurate idea of what transpired 
2021-05-30T18:48:36  <LjL> 2) this new "policy" wasn't even actual policy yet, it was expressly a policy *draft*, hence the existence of #freenode-policy-feedback, and yet he did this arbitrary thing suddenly without it being in the policy
2021-05-30T18:48:44  <LjL> it is painfully obvious that it was a random abuse of power
2021-05-30T18:49:07  <Tamara> this is pretty much how he operates as a rule

2021-05-30T18:50:01  <sem> you can see a pattern of "random abuse of power" from stealing channels, to pushing org changes, to installing his own staff, spamming, even possibly all the way back to christel selling freenode has its own abuse of power
2021-05-30T18:50:43  <Tamara> The fact he has any control at all is the result of an abuse of power

2021-05-30T19:18:23  <sem> what is the deal with etherium switching to a mode that still works as money but doesn't use all the electricity?
2021-05-30T19:19:14  <witeshark2> that is cheating
2021-05-30T19:20:05  <sem> maybe

2021-05-30T19:20:40  <sem> and how
2021-05-30T19:21:20  <daftykins> lol did you see the news piece from England where a police department thought they were busting a weed farm, but it was in fact a bunch o' *coin miners who were stealing electricity?
2021-05-30T19:21:35  <witeshark2> that i did
2021-05-30T19:21:40  <Anastasius> Ha!
2021-05-30T19:22:09  <daftykins> reminded me of that Netherlands weed setup bust when the snow came but their roof remained snow free!
2021-05-30T19:22:16  <waterytart> loll
2021-05-30T19:22:56  <witeshark2> lol
2021-05-30T19:23:02  <waterytart> pictures them trying to bust in the door to find plants and instead finds half of #defocus on their computers 
2021-05-30T19:23:42  <Anastasius> Well, that's fair. #defocus should be illegal too.
2021-05-30T19:24:21  <LjL> Anastasius, pretty sure they've been working on that
2021-05-30T19:24:39  <daftykins> what's weird is the story claimed they identified people coming and going, would have been trivial to get in remotely and reduce foot traffic :<

2021-05-30T19:26:34  <Anastasius> A number of years ago here locally, the feds or whomever were watching a house because of grow light activity, raiding their trash and whatnot. Turned out they were a couple of ex-CIA agents teaching their kids how to grow tomatoes in the basement hydroponically.
2021-05-30T19:26:36  <witeshark2> omg
2021-05-30T19:26:43  <Anastasius> That was.. a shitstorm.
2021-05-30T19:26:51  <witeshark2> hilarious :D
2021-05-30T19:26:58  <daftykins> bloody CIA every time
2021-05-30T19:27:26  <Anastasius> Oh no, there was a full house raid and all. The kids had guns against their heads.
2021-05-30T19:27:32  <Anastasius> It's not funny at all.
2021-05-30T19:28:08  <daftykins> survived 'cause they were a white family no doubt?
2021-05-30T19:28:37  <Anastasius> Probably. Sued the ass off the police later too, because connections.
2021-05-30T19:29:23  <daftykins> \o/
2021-05-30T19:34:19  <sem> is #defocus the chat room here?
2021-05-30T19:37:00  <witeshark2> right!

2021-06-01T20:52:08  <Anastasius> LjL: Baseball? Boring? Okay, it usually is.
2021-06-01T20:52:23  <waterytart> huh, didnt know they were having a coup. 
2021-06-01T20:52:53  <LjL> waterytart, the generals that put the president into place have now removed the president from his place because he removed two ministers who are generals
2021-06-01T20:52:55  <Lando-SpacePimp> Mali used to be the richest country in the world
2021-06-01T20:52:59  <waterytart> i wonder if we're overthrowing it or 
2021-06-01T20:53:01  <waterytart> ah ya
2021-06-01T20:53:02  <waterytart> ok
2021-06-01T20:53:16  <Anastasius> Refresh my memory. Where is Mali?
2021-06-01T20:53:26  <Anastasius> Is it Africa?

2021-06-02T10:55:31  <kitten> pteague_laptop: check what the warranty includes, mine had service fees that made it nto really worth it
2021-06-02T10:55:49  <pteague_laptop> my autn sent my mom an article from wired or something that was about amazon's new neighborhood wifi thing being turned on soon ... when devices that can utilize it download the update they'll automatically be turned on by default so my mom was trying to figure out how to turn it off ... but apparently it only shows up in the app if you have a device that can actually enable it
2021-06-02T10:57:17  <pteague_laptop> kitten, yeah, when i bought the house it was attached as an extra ... i read through a lot of customer comments & they said the warranty company makes you use their vendors
2021-06-02T10:57:58  <pteague_laptop> if it was $200 or something i might, but at almost $600 i could probably just buy a new fridge instead unless the economy really tanks

2021-06-02T15:58:42  <Anastasius> Ha, I was lounging around in bed for awhile Saturday morning for awhile with a book and it sounded like there was an actual squirrel war going on up there. I was half tempted to grab my bb pistol and go out and pick them off.

2021-06-02T16:00:17  <Anastasius> xD
2021-06-02T16:00:44  <Anastasius> They're kind of fun to watch, but stay off the house, please.

2021-06-02T17:37:20  <Anastasius> If anyone's up for that.
2021-06-02T17:37:37  <Anastasius> I have a Sunday wedding to attend so will be absent then most likely.
2021-06-02T17:38:45  <gav> I am playing mougus on Friday
2021-06-02T17:39:37  <Anastasius> Yeah, traditionally it was Saturday night anyway.
2021-06-02T17:39:50  <gav> Saturday we are going to Walsenburg
2021-06-02T17:40:20  <Anastasius> Give my regards to the Alpha Motel if it's still there.
2021-06-02T17:41:09  <Anastasius> Purple and orange shag carpeting and the most halluninogenic induced floor tile in the bathroom I've ever seen.

2021-06-02T17:53:05  <Anastasius> They might have remodeled sometime in the past 20 years.
2021-06-02T17:53:37  <Anastasius> But after driving for 18 hours, you need a place to crash. No matter the decor.
2021-06-02T17:54:17  <Anastasius> Also, the owners were kind of dicks because we woke them up at 3am.
2021-06-02T17:54:24  <Anastasius> But that's neither here nor there.
2021-06-02T17:58:26  <Anastasius> We'd started the day off from Kingman with a pit stop at the Grand Canyon to go "Yep, it's a giant hole in the ground", then off through the four corners, Durango and through to fucking Walsenburg. Gotta say that last part was a letdown.
2021-06-02T17:59:42  <Anastasius> After that we got up the next morning and cooked it back home, probably averaging 90 mph.
2021-06-02T18:00:06  <Anastasius> Because after three weeks of that horseshit, it was just time to be home.

2021-06-02T21:08:47  <genii> heh
2021-06-02T21:08:55  <waterytart> maybe that is what she said and then other was some homage act thing 
2021-06-02T21:09:26  <em> Fredy Mercury never says "Of the wooooooooorld" at the end of We are the Champions, even tho most people remember that too.
2021-06-02T21:10:05  <waterytart> oh at the very end of the studio recording he does not 
2021-06-02T21:11:03  * gav pours hot chocolate for em
2021-06-02T21:11:27  <CoJaBo> em: Most parodies of that scene in fact do say Mirror Mirror
2021-06-02T21:12:01  <CoJaBo> An the "of the world" thing is also a common variation, it's in an ad that plays on the radio like every 5 minutes even
2021-06-02T21:12:20  <gav> He sings that elsewhere in the song, right?
2021-06-02T21:12:47  <em> I don't think so
2021-06-02T21:12:56  <em> But anyway all of this was because it happened to me this morning.
2021-06-02T21:13:02  <waterytart> he does 
2021-06-02T21:13:05  <CoJaBo> Dunno; I've definitely heard versions that cut off after Of the woooooorld, tho I have no idea who sings them
2021-06-02T21:13:26  <waterytart> thought it was just certain live versions
2021-06-02T21:13:32  <em> When I found out there is supposedly an element called Tantalum
2021-06-02T21:13:35  <CoJaBo> I think I've solved the Monopoly Guy one too
2021-06-02T21:13:40  <em> That was never there my whole life but is now.
2021-06-02T21:14:14  <em> It's even like element 73 so it's not like those sketchy ones in the bottom rows that hardly exist.
2021-06-02T21:14:16  <gav> em: next to Tungsten
2021-06-02T21:14:27  <em> stuff is actually made of Tantulum and it didn't exist until this morning.
2021-06-02T21:14:37  <em> Totally bizarre.

2021-06-02T21:27:24  <CoJaBo> How've you never heard of tantalum, it's like one of the most common elements in any electronics =D
2021-06-02T21:29:42  <em> never heard of it

2021-06-02T21:33:28  <lizzie> CoJaBo: instructions unclear...  I built a computer out of tarantulas
2021-06-02T21:40:21  <CoJaBo> lizzie: Computers are built mostly from plastic, copper, tin, tantalum, and tarantulas.
2021-06-02T21:42:03  <Anastasius> Especially tarantulas.
2021-06-02T21:42:04  <gav> How do you think they get rid of all the bugs?
2021-06-02T21:49:16  <lizzie> tarantulas are great at eating bugs!
2021-06-02T21:50:09  <Anastasius> I have heard that feasting on cicadas is now a trend. Which, yuck.
2021-06-02T21:59:09  <pteague_laptop> it's the brood x thing i think right now ...
2021-06-02T21:59:48  <pteague_laptop> i don't live far enough east to be invaded by it ... somebody i heard talking about it goes out & brushes them off the bushes into jars & feeds them to their chickens
