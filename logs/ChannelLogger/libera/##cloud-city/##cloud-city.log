2021-05-19T22:19:37  <Shadow404> we need a bridge bot till we make the official decision what to do
2021-05-19T22:20:06  <Anastasius> No, we don't. Just go to libera.
2021-05-19T22:20:34  <Anastasius> The channel names are the same.
2021-05-19T22:20:53  <Shadow404> what about the latecomers
2021-05-19T22:21:07  <Shadow404> people that dont join for weeks
2021-05-19T22:21:15  <hoglahoo> they will find breadcrumbs in chantopic
2021-05-19T22:21:17  <Anastasius> We stick around on freenode to invite them.
2021-05-19T22:21:18  <MurkyBanana> they'll figure it out eventually
2021-05-19T22:34:57  <gav> [22:00]  h00k: Well I mean, how long has Freenode been your go to?

2021-05-19T22:36:59  <Anastasius> Well they were always stupid and evil, and given the people in charge of this network I wouldn't expect a lot of change.
2021-05-19T22:37:21  <Anastasius> Just a prediction.
2021-05-19T22:37:30  <gav> Eh, I don't think it'll be too bad
2021-05-19T22:37:45  <gav> Certainly not worse than freeneu
2021-05-19T22:38:06  <gav> The people can't even figure out how to kline
2021-05-19T22:38:25  <Anastasius> Tjat

2021-05-19T22:38:41  <Anastasius> That's a good sign.
2021-05-19T22:38:59  <pteague> he's over here now i think
2021-05-19T22:40:25  <m00se> the best part of it is watching the ircops say SHIT PISS MOTHERFUCKER CUNT AND OTHER BAD WORDS
2021-05-19T22:41:09  <Anastasius> they deserve it. George Carlin does not.
2021-05-19T22:41:36  <pteague> m00se, sounds like the teacher that cussed out the fully vaccinated student ...

2021-05-20T08:08:39  <h00k> I have qty 2.
2021-05-20T08:08:43  <h00k> Turns out I need active adapters.
2021-05-20T08:08:49  <Lando-SpacePimp> What's the difference?
2021-05-20T08:09:09  <h00k> Good question! Something about one-way vs two-way communication
2021-05-20T08:09:18  <h00k> passive doesn't work with this thunderbolt dock --> external monitors
2021-05-20T08:09:36  <h00k> but I imagine if your computer itself had Displayport and your monitors don't, it'd probably work
2021-05-20T08:09:39  <h00k> just not through a dock
2021-05-20T08:10:02  <Lando-SpacePimp> If it'll let me use a monitor that only has a DP cable on my laptop that only has an HDMI port?
2021-05-20T08:10:12  <h00k> negative, it's the other way
2021-05-20T08:10:24  <h00k> male display port to female HDMI

2021-05-20T09:33:45  <Spec_> got ghosted by "mrspec"

2021-05-20T09:33:56  <netdaemon> a wild hoglahoo has appeared too
2021-05-20T09:34:11  <Spec_> only had spec for 17 years, feels bad faith for him to take it
2021-05-20T09:34:35  <hoglahoo> this is like the new world
2021-05-20T09:34:40  <daftykins> Spec_: have you tried asking in #libera and pasting how long you had your freenode account reg'd for, or have they said 'tough' ?

2021-05-20T09:46:08  <Spec_> yeah
2021-05-20T09:46:09  <Spec_> not gonna happen
2021-05-20T09:46:28  <Spec_> 11:42 <spec> sorry to hear that, I used to use spec with prefix as spec was taken, spec was my first choice for years too on other services
2021-05-20T09:46:31  <Spec_> 11:42 <spec> so I guess if we share services we are always in conflict ;)
2021-05-20T09:46:51  <netdaemon> ;_;
2021-05-20T09:46:57  <hoglahoo> ugh
2021-05-20T09:47:22  <netdaemon> does libera accept unicode in the nick?
2021-05-20T09:47:39  <Spec_> it's a shame they don't have a policy to cross reference nickserv on freenode while they still can
2021-05-20T09:47:57  <daftykins> yeah, i would have thought that would be the least they could do

2021-05-20T10:02:31  <Spec_> you could try, he didn't seem to be like the type of person who would give a shit 
2021-05-20T10:02:41  <bazkie> Spec_: at some random point in time. a dick pic.
2021-05-20T10:02:50  <Spec_> that may be considered sexual harassment and i advise against it
2021-05-20T10:03:10  <bazkie> but i wanted to send a dick pic to my good friend spec that I know personally right
2021-05-20T10:03:16  <bazkie> so is it still sexual harassmant then?
2021-05-20T10:03:24  <Spec_> hmm
2021-05-20T10:03:26  <Spec_> a case of mistaken identity 
2021-05-20T10:03:30  <bazkie> exactly!

2021-05-20T14:03:13  <hoglahoo> I'm kinda hanging onto the big toe of the midwest
2021-05-20T14:03:17  <h00k> and there's like 2 bars and 1000000000000000000005 churches
2021-05-20T14:03:23  <hoglahoo> lol
2021-05-20T14:03:45  <hoglahoo> man we have loads of churches too, but its probably more like 1:3 ratio
2021-05-20T14:03:51  <h00k> Like...so... I guess I don't know how that is down there
2021-05-20T14:04:03  <h00k> but here, you belly-up to the bar, throw down a $20 or something if you're paying cash
2021-05-20T14:04:26  <h00k> the bartender takes your drink out of it, (few bucks), leaves the rest on the bar.  Nobody fucks with other people's money.
2021-05-20T14:04:35  <h00k> Order another drink, bartender just takes it out of the pile
2021-05-20T14:04:59  <netdaemon> i'v seen them do that here
2021-05-20T14:05:01  <hoglahoo> wow.  im surprised that works
2021-05-20T14:05:05  <hoglahoo> I dont drink outside my home, so I dunno how it is here either
2021-05-20T14:05:13  <h00k> in Pawhuska, EVERYONE was staring like I had 3 heads because I left my money on the bar
2021-05-20T14:05:18  <daftykins> life seems different in cheese land
2021-05-20T14:05:26  <h00k> I don't drink out anymore, but that's very normal here
2021-05-20T14:05:27  <hoglahoo> lol
2021-05-20T14:05:27  *** Time-Warp <Time-Warp!~Time-Warp@user/time-warp> has quit IRC (Quit: We Are Legion)
2021-05-20T14:05:42  <h00k> they all pocketed it right away like someone was going to fuck with it
2021-05-20T14:05:54  <h00k> It's just a very different cultural thing I ran into when I was there for work
2021-05-20T14:07:05  <h00k> they had this sketchy motel my work was trying to get me to stay at
2021-05-20T14:07:13  <daftykins> at some event a group of us were on a pub crawl, some faces i didn't know before... they all wanted to do a 'kitty' where you all throw in say £20 and the nominated person carries the stash and buys all the drinks
2021-05-20T14:07:19  <daftykins> i did not approve
2021-05-20T14:08:09  <daftykins> h00k: what made it sketchy?
2021-05-20T14:09:14  <h00k> daftykins: all of the windows were boarded up
2021-05-20T14:09:21  <h00k> which, I don't even know how that worked being 'open'
2021-05-20T14:09:38  <daftykins> D:
2021-05-20T14:09:45  <h00k> daftykins: it works if you all drink the same amount, otherwise that's not a great idea
2021-05-20T14:10:02  <netdaemon> daftykins: that opens it up to someone drinking way more than others
2021-05-20T14:10:22  <netdaemon> oh h00k covered that
2021-05-20T14:10:32  <daftykins> yep, you'd just be funding others pretty much
2021-05-20T14:10:33  <h00k> barely, well said
2021-05-20T14:10:33  <netdaemon> i should read backscroll

2021-05-20T14:11:19  <h00k> I miss out on a lot of garbage and drama
2021-05-20T14:11:28  <h00k> and am blissfully unaware of things, usually.

2021-05-20T14:12:42  <h00k> I should write notes down about people. But then I feel like it'd get creepy?
2021-05-20T14:13:09  <h00k> I just may ask you where you are again, please don't take offense :'( 
2021-05-20T14:14:08  <daftykins> merker be a windy city fella
2021-05-20T14:14:41  <hoglahoo> re-asking is better, imo. i do it all the time

2021-05-20T14:45:31  <Anastasius> That's sounding like a reasonable idea for later.
2021-05-20T14:50:37  <h00k> yeah

2021-05-20T18:59:11  <kevinf311-lap> i sorta want the Asus Zenfone 8
2021-05-20T19:01:33  <daftykins> hrmm not sure i would trust things they make that aren't motherboards
2021-05-20T19:02:14  <daftykins> btw Mischief would like you all to have your birthday gifts for her ready for Sunday - they can be left by her office blanket
2021-05-20T19:03:23  <kevinf311-lap> my bday gift will come in the form of a suspiciously convenient office chair to steal, at a time of Mischief's choosing 
2021-05-20T19:03:42  <kevinf311-lap> daftykins: but headphone jack!
2021-05-20T19:04:45  <daftykins> Pixel budget line \o/
2021-05-20T19:05:03  <daftykins> kevinf311-lap: hrmm this gift seems suspiciously well planned
2021-05-20T19:05:15  <kevinf311-lap> :D
2021-05-20T19:05:47  <netdaemon> i gots one complaint about my pixel 4a which i think i'm probably a minority in at this point
2021-05-20T19:06:02  <netdaemon> headphone jack takes some wiggles to get goin' good
2021-05-20T19:06:19  <kevinf311-lap> hrm
2021-05-20T19:09:14  <daftykins> o0
2021-05-20T19:09:19  <daftykins> hopefully a limited run kinda thing
2021-05-20T19:12:51  <MurkyBanana> I mean isn't a phone technically just a tiny motherboard?
2021-05-20T19:13:12  <daftykins> hah not remotely
2021-05-20T19:13:37  <MurkyBanana> they can be used as remotes :P
2021-05-20T19:13:53  <netdaemon> sort of
2021-05-20T19:14:05  <daftykins> the phone is at the mercy of that company taking the OS, putting an ugly skin on top of it, never updating it again, then shipping it out to victims
2021-05-20T19:14:23  <hoglahoo> kinda like mac
2021-05-20T19:14:28  <MurkyBanana> ^

2021-05-20T20:02:55  <daftykins> huh, what verification?
2021-05-20T20:03:52  <pteague> this channel requires a valid login/username? with chanserv i think
2021-05-20T20:04:21  <pteague> so if it hasn't validated you yet, your /join attempt will fail until you are

2021-05-21T10:06:56  <moocow> Spec_: which ufos

2021-05-21T10:09:49  <WateryTart> Yay we gots aliens
2021-05-21T10:10:01  <WateryTart> Dont blame me though, i voted for Kodos.
2021-05-21T10:11:05  <genii> They probably don't want to hang out, Earth is probably like the hick backwater planet they just want to leave as soon as they get here
2021-05-21T10:12:54  <moocow> Spec_: I think that report will conclude nothing useful!
2021-05-21T10:13:25  <genii> "They are still unidentified"
2021-05-21T10:14:31  <Spec_> moocow: obviously
2021-05-21T10:14:46  <Spec_> although there is a claim the gov has footage "50ft away from cockpit"
2021-05-21T10:15:02  <Spec_> it is pretty absurd for all the video to be super garbage low resolution bullshit
2021-05-21T10:15:26  <Spec_> genii: my thoughts were far more absurd 
2021-05-21T10:20:08  <moocow> "it was us all along, sorry"
2021-05-21T10:21:19  <daftykins> Spec_: what variety of out-of-sorts are you feeling after your dose, also which did you get?
2021-05-21T10:21:30  <Spec_> daftykins: pfizer 
2021-05-21T10:21:42  <Spec_> my stomach is feelin iffy and my head is feelin like a headache is coming on

2021-05-21T10:22:59  *** moomoo is now known as moocow
2021-05-21T10:23:07  <Spec_> such is the gamble in life 
2021-05-21T10:23:13  <Spec_> ah, my arm hurts, too
2021-05-21T10:23:18  <Spec_> but that is not so bad 
2021-05-21T10:23:22  <moocow> Spec_: first jab or second
2021-05-21T10:23:26  <Spec_> second 
2021-05-21T10:23:29  <moocow> ah yes
2021-05-21T10:23:37  <moocow> that means its working!
2021-05-21T10:23:44  <Spec_> i think that's not a true statement, but sure 
2021-05-21T10:23:55  <Spec_> that is, the absence of side effects isn't correlated to it not working
2021-05-21T10:24:46  <moocow> Spec_: side effects are corrolated with immune response though
2021-05-21T10:25:04  <Spec_> yeah
2021-05-21T10:25:21  <Spec_> but i think i'd be okay without suffering symptoms 
2021-05-21T10:25:33  <moocow> and with pfizer side effects are greater on the second jab and on the first jab for people with exidting immunity from infection
2021-05-21T10:26:22  <moocow> and while it could still be wroking fine without side effects, you coukdnt be SURE
2021-05-21T10:27:28  <Spec_> hehe

2021-05-21T10:31:35  <Spec_> moocow: when do these symptoms like fever start
2021-05-21T10:31:44  <moocow> that poor guy with no antibodies after two shots :(
2021-05-21T10:32:01  <moocow> Spec_: probably 12-36 hours
2021-05-21T10:32:15  <Spec_> i see, so there's hope i'll get a fever and chills and be extra miserable
2021-05-21T10:32:28  <Spec_> moocow: he's immune to resistance 
2021-05-21T10:32:31  <moocow> fatigue is what I've heard a lot of

2021-05-22T19:21:21  <Anastasius> kn100: Not cats, but one of my recent photos of the Mongo/Molly complex. https://i.imgur.com/FmaD27m.jpg
2021-05-22T19:21:40  <kn100> I am in love with them both already 
2021-05-22T19:21:43  <Anastasius> Almost cats.
2021-05-22T19:21:58  <kn100> My cat is more doglike than any cat I've ever had
2021-05-22T19:22:38  <Anastasius> I'm pretty sure Molly (left) thinks she's a cat. She's always crawling on furniture like she thinks she is anyway.
2021-05-22T19:32:59  <Time-Warp> kn100: ADORABLE
2021-05-22T19:37:12  <kn100> okaay okkayyyyy 
2021-05-22T19:37:16  <kn100> have a more recent photo https://i.ibb.co/Wyf8ShT/fit-2048.jpg
2021-05-22T19:37:34  <kn100> this is how he sleeps whenever I play games, for whatever reason
2021-05-22T19:39:35  <Anastasius> Hand warmer cat.
2021-05-22T19:40:50  <kn100> he's honestly the most clingy bloody cat in the world. He's a rescue, and I honestly feel his gratitude every day. It's almost annoying how much he insists on showing it
2021-05-22T19:41:22  <Anastasius> This is not a bad thing.
2021-05-22T19:41:45  <kn100> he also vomits fairly often
2021-05-22T19:41:56  <kn100> and requires stupid expensive food to...you know... survive
2021-05-22T19:42:42  <kn100> and can't go outside because he eats things he shouldn't. Literally banned from going outside by the vet. And can't open his eyes very much so permanently looks like he's asleep, and there's nothing that can be done about that either. He's a fairly defective cat hahahaha
2021-05-22T19:43:09  <Anastasius> You are doing the Lord's work.
2021-05-22T19:43:10  <daftykins> d'aww

2021-05-22T19:57:35  <Anastasius> I love his eyepatch!
2021-05-22T19:58:58  <kn100> his original name was patch. We changed it. Was absolutely hilarious when we figured out the RSPCA had sold our information off to various insurance companies and they started calling us like "Hi, I'm calling about..... Teapot...Pumpkin?" - I was half tempted to reply and ask if they were having a stroke

2021-05-23T08:52:57  <jip> you have wall plans daftykins?
2021-05-23T08:53:36  <daftykins> after tearing down the wallpaper that had detached and letting it dry out in that corner, nope - not done a thing about it
2021-05-23T08:54:18  <jip> water problems?
2021-05-23T08:56:19  <daftykins> it's possible, but there's no obvious source... my Dad reckoned it was just the wallpaper stopping it from breathing, so efflorescence has been coming up

2021-05-23T09:00:31  <jip> hmmm, not sure the wall should breathe with so much spit the paper drops off ;-)
2021-05-23T09:00:58  <jip> I hope there is no leak. But you would probably smell it if there is a serious problem
2021-05-23T09:01:27  <jip> Mischief is the best

2021-05-23T09:11:57  <waterytart> fucking insanity
2021-05-23T09:12:11  <waterytart> it's probably got drugs soaked in the walls
2021-05-23T09:12:27  <daftykins> they're absolutely dreaming xD
2021-05-23T09:12:31  <waterytart> this is why i can't live in So Cal
2021-05-23T09:12:38  <waterytart> no they are selling at those prices!
2021-05-23T09:12:54  <waterytart> that ugly piece of shit is worth more than half mil
2021-05-23T09:13:15  <daftykins> mental, so much work required
2021-05-23T09:13:17  <waterytart> they are selling like hotcakes 
2021-05-23T09:13:34  <waterytart> my kids' uncle just bought a house in OC a condo actually, 
2021-05-23T09:13:38  <waterytart> $680k
2021-05-23T09:13:55  <waterytart> needs a ton of work
2021-05-23T09:14:51  <waterytart> someone tried to outbid him cash because he asked for repairs and he took it without the repairs so some investor wouldn't out bid 
2021-05-23T09:15:18  <waterytart> the seller liked him so they accepted their offer over the investor even though the investor was offering 10k over him
2021-05-23T09:15:40  <waterytart> this is why regular people can't buy houses in america anymore , or you have to go to buttfuck Egypt like i did
2021-05-23T09:19:15  <daftykins> come for the high property values, stay for the fires and droughts

2021-05-23T20:27:20  <Shadow404> why?
2021-05-23T20:28:08  <Shadow404> sounds like unnecesary busy work to me

2021-05-23T20:29:00  <NoCode_> A new fab shop going in. 
2021-05-23T20:29:43  <Shadow404> fair enough
2021-05-23T20:30:06  <NoCode_> So I gotta move shit around, condense racking, take stuff out where they want to put the fab shop and reconfigure the warehouse.
2021-05-23T20:30:19  <Shadow404> i knew bosses when i worked at amazon would re-arrange the warehouse to create busy work to make it look like they were improving things, get promoted and drop the project like a bad habit leaving the warehouse a mess
2021-05-23T20:30:37  <Spec_> really?
2021-05-23T20:30:40  <Shadow404> yep
2021-05-23T20:30:59  <Spec_> i'd expect amazon to use hard data to make promotion decisions 
2021-05-23T20:31:02  <Shadow404> and of course I.T. was left in that mess too moving cameras/ap's/and network jacks
2021-05-23T20:31:08  <Shadow404> Spec_: bahahaha
2021-05-23T20:31:19  <Shadow404> maybe in procurement, but not in the warehouse flow
2021-05-23T20:31:54  <NoCode_> nah, new product lines here. More manufacturing standpoint to where we can do custom work, sell for cheaper, but still have less cost and still get way more product out. Instead of buying product to resell, or get custom plans drawn up to get manufactured by a 3rd party. We'll just draw the shit up, manufacture, and sell.
2021-05-23T20:31:59  <Shadow404> then when that boss left that started the project, theyw would reverse all his changes
2021-05-23T20:32:11  <NoCode_> So it'll be way cheaper in the long run.
2021-05-23T20:32:21  <Shadow404> kool
2021-05-23T20:32:53  <NoCode_> Yeah man.

2021-05-24T07:28:29  <h00k> Yeah, same here. I'm not ready for the week
2021-05-24T07:28:34  <bazkie> same
2021-05-24T07:28:38  <h00k> but this weekend was actually much needed
2021-05-24T07:29:28  <h00k> My daughter woke me up yesterday morning telling me 'we forgot to make (grandma) coffee' and that threw me into "were we supposed to? why? is it Monday? what day is it? oh hit, 7:35, we make coffee before I bring her to daycare, fuck it's monday and she's late" etc etc
2021-05-24T07:29:31  <h00k> then I figured it out
2021-05-24T07:29:44  <h00k> and had one whole extra day of weekend
2021-05-24T07:29:49  <netdaemon> i went to visit some family friends over the weekend, that was a nice refresher from being stuck home
2021-05-24T07:29:59  <netdaemon> we all fully vaccinated so i figured it was fine
2021-05-24T07:36:21  <h00k> sweet action
2021-05-24T07:43:59  <bazkie> lol h00k
2021-05-24T07:44:17  <bazkie> that's better than the other way around, thinking it's weekend and then realizing it's monday

2021-05-24T07:59:18  <bazkie> agree
2021-05-24T08:00:17  <cym> seriously just spent 6 hours debugging some lambda bullshit. Nothing I changed, just broke because of stuff they changed

2021-05-24T08:06:47  <h00k> cym: hot take
2021-05-24T08:07:10  <h00k> serverles servers
2021-05-24T08:09:26  <cym> serverless is just so frustrating to work with, especially lambda
2021-05-24T08:09:41  <cym> their more specific use cases like Glue are more useful, and less irritating to work with
2021-05-24T08:09:56  <cym> I miss the days of just copying binaries back and forth hahaha
2021-05-24T08:10:56  <Spec_> what do you use it for?
2021-05-24T08:11:03  <Spec_> i've had good experience with the few things i've implemented in lambda 
2021-05-24T08:11:05  <NoCode> sup
2021-05-24T08:11:11  <Spec_> and the gcp equivalent 
2021-05-24T08:11:22  <NoCode> Last day off. \o/
2021-05-24T08:11:54  <cym> Can't go into too much detail I don't think, but if you're using api gateway, lambda lets you modify in flight requests
2021-05-24T08:12:05  <cym> which is quite a useful ability
2021-05-24T08:12:42  <Spec_> yea
2021-05-24T08:12:53  <Spec_> i've never used aws glue 
2021-05-24T08:13:22  <Spec_> cym: i use lambda to keep a bucket proper and clean automaticalily 
2021-05-24T08:13:49  <Spec_> there is a manifest that states what is permitted in a style, and the lambda just auto deletes anything not conforming, pretty easy but works well
2021-05-24T08:14:02  <cym> heh, that sounds like a nice use case
2021-05-24T08:14:12  <cym> Glue is actually pretty excellent for data analysis type stuff
2021-05-24T08:14:26  <Spec_> in another case, i wrote a .json map with terraform and the lambda fires off and checks things out, and emits log messages, for auditing reasons 
2021-05-24T08:14:27  <cym> one of the few aws services I've used that doesn't make me want to gouge my eyes out
2021-05-24T08:14:43  <Spec_> cym: have you ever used gcp
2021-05-24T08:14:57  <cym> nope, we're an aws only shop here and my last job was too
2021-05-24T08:15:00  <Spec_> it is so hackfuckingerly janky when you return to aws you'll be all
2021-05-24T08:15:01  <Spec_> 'this is ok'
2021-05-24T08:15:08  <cym> and personally I avoid aws/gcp/azure like the plague. 
2021-05-24T08:15:19  <Spec_> cym: ah
2021-05-24T08:15:25  <cym> got an *incredibly* good deal on my personal server 
2021-05-24T08:15:39  <Spec_> i only do cloud automation work these days ;9
2021-05-24T08:15:41  <Spec_> :(
2021-05-24T08:15:55  <cym> like, 60 EUR or something a year for 8GB ram, 2x epyc cores, etc

2021-05-24T08:33:49  <Spec_> cym: oh i know what i saw, lol 
2021-05-24T08:33:59  <cym> the nas sits on top of a pen to help airflow, and the router literally has an l bracket glued to it to improve airflow
2021-05-24T08:34:05  <NoCode> I wonder if the Polska deli is open. I'm getting hungry. Maybe I'll walk down there at 11 and see to grab lunch.
2021-05-24T08:34:09  <cym> there's even a tiny 50mm fan blu tacked to the top of the router hahahahahah
2021-05-24T08:34:24  <cym> netdaemon I'm running Ubuntu server on there
2021-05-24T08:34:29  <daftykins> cym: such a clean, sterile looking environment... let me ship you some Mischief fur to fix that up some!
2021-05-24T08:34:36  <cym> Spec_, not yet, podman just pulls from the docker registry so I don't care
2021-05-24T08:34:36  <Spec_> ^
2021-05-24T08:34:47  <cym> daftykins it's hidden inside a cupboard with zero airflow
2021-05-24T08:34:55  <h00k> cym: interesting, I've had customers ask, but I've got zero anecdotal things on it
2021-05-24T08:34:56  <cym> so my cat hair doesn't get to interfere with it
2021-05-24T08:35:00  <daftykins> :D
2021-05-24T08:35:04  <Spec_> cym: i did an evaluation of quay.io and the service they host themselves went down site-wide like, 4 times during the evaluation period 
2021-05-24T08:35:11  <cym> ahahahaha
2021-05-24T08:35:13  <cym> nice one redhat
2021-05-24T08:35:18  <h00k> Day after release customers are like "hey, how much of this vSphere with Tanzu you got, I need someone with 5 years experiences and super expert on it"
2021-05-24T08:35:25  <Spec_> cym: my official write up included, "how could we expect to run this service better than the people who write it? and they seem not to be able to"
2021-05-24T08:35:25  <h00k> uhhh bruh, it's been out a week or two
2021-05-24T08:35:31  <NoCode> Maybe a proper synology NAS is on queue soon. then I can play with some containerized things.
2021-05-24T08:36:13  <cym> NoCode - these lenovo nodes are dirt cheap, you can pick something up with 8gb of ram, a full fat x86 cpu, ssd based storage, etc, for around 100GBP if you're lucky on eBay
2021-05-24T08:36:19  <Spec_> the nice thing about containers, and their use case, btw, is as such: build software within a container environment -> test that software within that container 
2021-05-24T08:36:29  <Spec_> at that point you can give the container to other people and it will work, for it's been tested, etc 
2021-05-24T08:36:31  <cym> mine's an Intel i5 6400T, 4GB of ram, and 512GB of ssd storage for about 150 quid. I overpaid though
2021-05-24T08:36:51  <cym> 12w idle power too :D
2021-05-24T08:36:59  <NoCode> cym, Node = NAS?
2021-05-24T08:37:13  <cym> nah, the thinkcenter unit on the right of my photo
2021-05-24T08:37:13  <NoCode> Sounds interesting
2021-05-24T08:37:18  <NoCode> ahg okay
2021-05-24T08:37:22  <daftykins> never seen anyone use the word 'node' for an SFF PC before
2021-05-24T08:37:29  <cym> the nas was also around 120 quid without hard drives, and then I paid around 180 for 2x 4tb drives
2021-05-24T08:37:35  <Spec_> daftykins: all the computers are referred to as nodes these days sir 
2021-05-24T08:37:43  <daftykins> u wot m8
2021-05-24T08:37:48  <Spec_> daftykins: node this, node that, you're a node 
2021-05-24T08:37:49  <cym> My vacuum cleaner is also a node in my network
2021-05-24T08:37:54  <Spec_> ^
2021-05-24T08:37:55  <cym> It exports metrics to promethius 
2021-05-24T08:37:58  <Spec_> hahaha
2021-05-24T08:38:01  <NoCode> A free node!
2021-05-24T08:38:02  <cym> I am not even joking
2021-05-24T08:38:05  <Spec_> lemme see your promql for your vacuum cleaner 
2021-05-24T08:38:13  <Spec_> what do you track
2021-05-24T08:38:17  <Spec_> charts and graphs!!!!
2021-05-24T08:38:41  <Spec_> cym: fwiw, i hate promql that shit is ugly

2021-05-24T08:39:19  <cym> very little honestly, but it was fun to set up
2021-05-24T08:39:26  <Spec_> lol
2021-05-24T08:39:31  <Spec_> fantastic 
2021-05-24T08:39:33  <cym> my vacuum turns out to be a completely abandoned ubuntu 14.04 install
2021-05-24T08:39:34  <Spec_> Rat?
2021-05-24T08:39:45  <Time-Warp> !ops
2021-05-24T08:39:46  <ubnot2> Time-Warp: Error: "ops" is not a valid command.
2021-05-24T08:39:51  <Time-Warp> testing lol
2021-05-24T08:39:57  <Spec_> why does your vacuum have a computer? none of this looks...vacuum related
2021-05-24T08:40:07  <Spec_> i wanna see suuuckPower 
2021-05-24T08:40:14  <daftykins> don't we all?
2021-05-24T08:40:23  <cym> Rat was my raspberry pi. All my nodes get animal names. Had a Pi 3b that was called mouse, then upgraded to a pi 4, which I called rat, since rat is bigger than a mouse, and I recently sold that pi 4 and upgraded to that lenovo node and that's called possum :P
2021-05-24T08:40:35  <Spec_> cym: if you chart your vacuum motor temps you would be able to predict when your vacuum is getting clogged/motor is failing/etc 
2021-05-24T08:40:40  <cym> I also have Bear, which is my node off in netcup, since it's enormous
2021-05-24T08:40:49  <NoCode> :D
2021-05-24T08:40:52  <cym> Spec_ check out the Valetudo project 
2021-05-24T08:41:08  <Spec_> lol
2021-05-24T08:41:09  <Spec_> ohhhhh
2021-05-24T08:41:12  <Spec_> one of these bois 
2021-05-24T08:41:17  <Spec_> i was thinking of an upright vacuum cleaner
2021-05-24T08:41:25  <Spec_> haha
2021-05-24T08:41:26  <cym> it's all very cool what's happening in the robot vacuum space. You can have a robot vacuum with all the trimmings, and none of the ridiculous amounts of data transfer between the vacuum and who knows who
2021-05-24T08:41:44  <Spec_> yea
2021-05-24T08:41:47  <cym> literally observed over 15gb of traffic between the vacuum and some server in China over the course of a month.........
2021-05-24T08:41:52  <Spec_> haha
2021-05-24T08:42:00  <Spec_> now they know the internal map of your house
2021-05-24T08:42:04  <cym> think it was sending raw LIDAR data
2021-05-24T08:42:12  <cym> probably training some ML model
2021-05-24T08:42:15  <Spec_> yea
2021-05-24T08:42:24  <Spec_> that's a pretty neat project right there 
2021-05-24T08:42:51  <Spec_> i have a coworker who recently quit and joined grafana
2021-05-24T08:42:59  <Spec_> he was very smart but a bit of a dick

2021-05-24T08:56:43  <h00k> People skills are lacking, often

2021-05-24T08:56:57  <daftykins> people are the worst! leave me to my machines
2021-05-24T08:57:44  <cym> they really are
2021-05-24T08:57:46  <netdaemon> IT and dev work are severely underappreciated, i imagine that has something to do with it too
2021-05-24T08:58:22  <cym> like, I do my best as an engineer to be as kind and as open as possible with everyone, and that's what's gotten me to where I am today (not any particularly high places for sure, but generally I feel respected!)
2021-05-24T08:58:25  <netdaemon> if everything's working "why do we have you on staff", when everything breaks "OMG WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING, WHY DO YOU WORK HERE!?"
2021-05-24T08:58:37  <cym> but I work in startups, so I'm probably in a bubble
2021-05-24T08:58:52  <daftykins> it's not a great conversation starter, i remember going to wealthy fella's wedding, had one introduction to some couple he knew - it went like this, "Dave does his IT!" - "oh" * people wander off

2021-05-24T10:16:25  <cym> little bugger even knows what times he gets fed, and will scream and scram you until you feed him at 9am, 1pm, 6pm, and 12am
2021-05-24T10:16:39  <cym> makes me wonder if we fed him 8 times would me be able to figure that out
2021-05-24T10:16:47  <waterytart> Guinness does that, its like the exorcist if we let him eat too much

2021-05-24T10:22:35  <waterytart> I think also what happened was we got a shipment of bad dog food and she wouldnt eat it, and i realized it was all spoiled even though the date was good. So now shes being aversive .
2021-05-24T10:22:45  <waterytart> Maybe i should change the brand.
2021-05-24T10:23:04  <waterytart> Lando-SpacePimp:  whats a good brand?

2021-05-25T14:23:18  <netdaemon> 6 days then new job \o/

2021-05-25T14:24:23  <waterytart> Sounds like a good time to be had
2021-05-25T14:27:11  <netdaemon> definitely, new company sounds pretty nice to work for but we'll see after the honeymoon period
2021-05-25T14:27:51  <Anastasius> Still going to be remoting in and stuff?
2021-05-25T14:28:09  <kn100> I'm not sure I could go back to full office work at this point
2021-05-25T14:28:24  <kn100> gotten so comfortable working from home and my wfh setup is so killer now going back to the macbook gives me a migraine just thinking about it
2021-05-25T14:28:58  <netdaemon> Anastasius: yup, this place will be full remote as well
2021-05-25T14:29:13  <Anastasius> Cool
2021-05-25T14:29:51  <netdaemon> everyone i'v met so far has been super nice as well
2021-05-25T14:30:31  <Anastasius> \o/
2021-05-25T14:30:40  <netdaemon> including the guy that will be my direct boss
2021-05-25T14:33:41  <netdaemon> just in time to get a new job too because shit is going down hard at the current company XD
2021-05-25T14:34:03  <Anastasius> Hehe, good timing then. Change can be a good thing.
2021-05-25T14:35:01  <kn100> netdaemon what do you do may I ask
2021-05-25T14:35:35  <netdaemon> kn100: .net w/ C# and angular developer
2021-05-25T14:35:50  <netdaemon> i mean i can work with more than that, but i'v been typecasted
2021-05-25T14:36:17  <kn100> netdaemon lots of contracting gigs around with that sort of stack!
2021-05-25T14:36:40  <netdaemon> kn100: i found that out when i was on the search for a job XD
2021-05-25T14:36:48  <netdaemon> so lucky lucky me!
2021-05-25T14:38:23  <netdaemon> i do enjoy .net and don't hate angular so that's fine by me
2021-05-25T14:38:23  <kn100> .net is a nice language, I wish I could find some more time to learn it some more. The whole .net core thing confused the crap out of me back in the day though!
2021-05-25T14:38:50  <netdaemon> kn100: worry not. .net 5 is merging it all back (it'll all be based off .net core)
2021-05-25T14:39:09  <netdaemon> or is it 6... very soon at any rate if not already!
2021-05-25T14:39:11  <kn100> That's good news but too late, I am now also typecast as a Golang/Ruby guy
2021-05-25T14:39:21  <netdaemon> XD
2021-05-25T14:39:21  <kn100> but slowly transitioning to platform work more exclusively
2021-05-25T14:39:37  <netdaemon> employer sees $popular_lang on resume, they latch onto it
2021-05-25T14:39:56  <kn100> Ironically at both jobs I've had in my career so far I've been hired as a Go guy, and ended up doing basically everything else
2021-05-25T14:41:00  <kn100> about once a month I'm forced to learn something completely new. The latest learnings involved Python and Pyspark (AWS Glue). Before that was AWS API Gateway. Before that was Lambda. Before that was Terraform. Before that was Gokit (a framework for Golang). The tech hamster wheel never stops turning!
2021-05-25T14:41:17  <kn100> good fun though, never bored
2021-05-25T14:41:49  <netdaemon> that it do not. i will probably encounter aws at some point
2021-05-25T14:43:12  <netdaemon> i had a look at golang a while back and it didn't seem extraordinary to me...but i'm pretty sure that's the point. it's supposed to be boring!
2021-05-25T14:44:30  <kn100> that's kind of the point yeah
2021-05-25T14:44:36  <kn100> you can literally learn it in probably 2 hours
2021-05-25T14:44:42  <kn100> and the concurrency model is just lovely
2021-05-25T14:44:55  <netdaemon> i'm pretty sure i felt comfortable in it in the 20 minute quick thing i went through
2021-05-25T14:45:21  <netdaemon> but i'm comfortable with C style syntax. i already clean up unused crap so there's no clashing there with it
2021-05-25T14:45:34  <netdaemon> just learning the go way of doing things
2021-05-25T14:45:50  <netdaemon> no multilayered ternaries ;)
2021-05-25T14:45:56  <netdaemon> or ternaries at all for that matter

2021-05-25T14:48:22  <kn100> I fleet between Ruby and Go, and always find myself missing stuff about each language in both. Ruby has wonderfully expressive testing, and a ridiculous amount of magic. Golang never hides anything from you, and it's clear as day what you're doing, but the lack of expressability can be rather annoying
2021-05-25T14:49:06  <netdaemon> i remember ruby being extremely flexible when i poked at it years and years ago

2021-05-26T16:02:24  <daftykins> just had curry so not half bad thanks! although i began taking a look at a SOP document for a pal, seems our setup needs some kinda ongoing monitoring to provide alerts for 'data incidents', no idea what would be a good solution there
2021-05-26T16:03:44  <kn100> Data incidents as in data breaches or loss?
2021-05-26T16:04:04  <kn100> Or are we talking more availability

2021-05-26T16:11:11  <kn100> That's fairly incredible that we didn't have a factoid for that 
2021-05-26T16:11:48  <Anastasius> Part of the process was purging all the dumb old Seveas factoids I believe.
2021-05-26T16:12:45  <kn100> Gods work.
2021-05-26T16:12:59  <kn100> Jesus I got nextcloud up and running last night rootless
2021-05-26T16:13:09  <kn100> What a hateful piece of software to set up
2021-05-26T16:13:19  <gav> I don't mind it
2021-05-26T16:13:47  <kn100> It's more specific to my setup, since I'm running it in a container as a low privilage user, which leads to all sorts of fun problems 
2021-05-26T16:15:57  <daftykins> i love nextcloud <3 got a few instances now, in fact the thing i said above looks like it might be handled by nextcloud features... if i updated from v19 anyway
2021-05-26T16:16:07  <kn100> Like for instance the container runs some processes as root (within the container) and others as www-data. Root maps to the uid of the unprivileged user on the host and therefore can access stuff, www-data obviously maps to a totally different uid. Never did quite find a good solution to that while still maintaining my preferred ownership over the
2021-05-26T16:16:07  <kn100> files, so nextcloud gets its own special folder that it owns whichever way it wants. Then there's the Linuxserver.io docker image by default coming with self signed ssl with no sane way to switch it off. Then there's just some concepts in docker-compose that don't map well to podman-compose, etc etc 
2021-05-26T16:16:51  <kn100> It's amazingly functional software, but still I'm fighting with strange issues. For instance the built in Collabera stuff just...straight up doesn't work for me. Will need to investigate further! 
2021-05-26T16:17:23  <daftykins> i tend to go fully manual for installation inside 'buntu focal VMs
2021-05-26T16:17:34  <daftykins> i heard similar woes from someone who tried the snap... lol
2021-05-26T16:17:46  <kn100> I just wanted a thing that runs in a container, stores it shit somewhere replicated, and doesn't fight me on it. A lot of it comes down to my move to a totally rootless setup 
2021-05-26T16:18:03  <kn100> Previously I was running docker as root *bleugh*
2021-05-26T16:19:15  <kn100> Oh and I spent literally 2 hours debugging why no matter what I did I got a 401 forbidden from nginx. Literally tried everything, no logs from nginx, no logs from nextcloud. Guess what it was?
2021-05-26T16:19:28  <kn100> Turns out my fucking ROUTER runs nginx and I hadn't done the port forwarding rule
2021-05-26T16:19:36  <kn100> Oh man I was so mad 
2021-05-26T16:19:58  <daftykins> xD
2021-05-26T16:20:50  <daftykins> in those situations where it's not immediately obvious what you're being served a page from, i like to put a mischief pic in the doc root so i can kinda test for that
2021-05-26T16:26:01  <kn100> I should have done that 
2021-05-26T16:26:19  <kn100> I was tired and very unhappy at how long it had taken at that point lol
2021-05-26T16:28:33  <daftykins> one day i hope to learn not to update things late at night xD
2021-05-26T16:28:44  <daftykins> that's my regular mistake
2021-05-26T16:29:43  <kn100> Ditto, bloody ditto
2021-05-26T16:29:47  <kn100> And also to document stuff 
2021-05-26T16:31:26  <daftykins> thankfully Uni kinda drilled that into me, we had these Linux lab sessions where we had to keep a logbook
2021-05-26T16:31:41  <daftykins> practically had to write up all but your trips to the building facilities

2021-05-26T23:05:14  <NoCode> I need to fix my USB port on my phone. It looks like a simple fix at least.
2021-05-26T23:06:24  <NoCode> Wonder if there's any other place better than ebay for a trusted source for replacement
2021-05-26T23:07:35  <gav> NoCode: Try cleaning it out first. Sometimes they get all gakked up with lint and stuff and makes it seem like it's not workign
2021-05-26T23:08:02  <NoCode> Nah, it's broke I think
2021-05-26T23:08:20  <gav> What's it doing?
2021-05-26T23:08:51  <NoCode> contacts won't work until I really press into it. It'll also just slip out
2021-05-26T23:09:41  <NoCode> Tried difference cables
2021-05-26T23:09:47  <NoCode> they don't even work
2021-05-26T23:09:52  <NoCode> sp i dunno
2021-05-26T23:10:39  <gav> NoCode: Yeah, what happens is lint gets into the port and then as you plug the cable it, it compacts the lint against the back. Eventually it gets so full that the locks in the plug can't engage with the port, so the cable falls out.
2021-05-26T23:24:24  <NoCode> gav, It's a bit better!
2021-05-26T23:24:42  <gav> Nice!
2021-05-26T23:25:21  <Anastasius> Is there a way to get into those tiny ports and just swab things out without breaking anything?
2021-05-26T23:25:49  <gav> Yeah, use a needle or a pin or something
2021-05-26T23:25:56  <gav> And don't be a hamfist
2021-05-26T23:26:20  <Anastasius> Maybe a toothpick dipped in rubbing alcohol.
2021-05-26T23:29:36  <NoCode> Used a sewing needle
2021-05-26T23:29:41  <NoCode> a tiny one

2021-05-26T23:34:12  <NoCode> replacement doesn't look too hard too
2021-05-26T23:35:05  <gav> Micro/Type-C USB Cables are supposed to have the latches in the cable (cheap, easy to replace component) rather than in the plug, so it's probably still just gummed up with gonk
2021-05-26T23:35:52  <NoCode> hmmm ok
2021-05-26T23:36:02  <NoCode> maybe a new cable will work now
2021-05-26T23:36:08  <NoCode> I think I bought 2 or 3
2021-05-26T23:36:17  <NoCode> and none of them worked

2021-05-28T07:49:08  <waterytart> I love how I told myself to sleep in this week because no overtime, and every morning i've been wide awake at fucking 6am. 
2021-05-28T07:51:30  <hoglahoo> I guess thats barely better than waking up at 6am all groggy and messed up.  gotta look for those silver linings xD
2021-05-28T07:56:26  <waterytart> yeah i've been so exhausted during the day though, been going to bed early and waking up too early, then getting tired by noon again 
2021-05-28T07:57:08  <waterytart> i'm all fucking chipper now, but in 5 hours i'm gonna want a nap

2021-05-28T21:41:29  <Anastasius> It's kind of odd how they understand loss like that. But I guess not unexpected.

2021-05-28T21:42:52  <waterytart> ginny knew the first night, i was so tired i just fell asleep with bubba next to me and ginny had somehow snuggled next to him and me that morning

2021-05-29T17:35:06  <NoCode> Getting it tuned up within a 32nd of measure. Lol. 
2021-05-29T17:37:30  <NoCode> Each lug had relative pressure to the next. So while adjusting one the others surrounding go higher or lower. You can keep going around and fiddling but by getting relative tension from adjusting other lugs your not tuning will dial in the one you want.
2021-05-29T17:37:44  <NoCode> Pretty wild to think about
2021-05-29T17:37:59  <NoCode> Last drum to tune. Woot woot

2021-05-29T17:52:40  <NoCode> I'm also tuning both batter and redo heads.
2021-05-29T17:53:04  <NoCode> Reso.
2021-05-29T17:53:49  <NoCode> I've tune the high tom to a lower tuning because it's quite small
2021-05-29T17:54:42  <NoCode> It can go quite high to low depending on the head
2021-05-29T17:55:20  <NoCode> I wonder if I could make 300 or 400 off these with em tuned up now
2021-05-29T18:04:03  <daftykins> but you need 'em!

2021-05-30T21:32:09  <kevinf311-lap> nah, still same setup
2021-05-30T21:32:34  <kevinf311-lap> i have worked a bit on the core switch this weekend but i think i'm not quite ready for the swapover still
2021-05-30T21:32:59  <daftykins> ooh getting down to the crunch!
2021-05-30T21:33:42  <daftykins> sometimes you just have to jump in with both feet
2021-05-30T21:36:38  <kevinf311-lap> i removed the security cam VLAN from the plan because it was making DHCP pools difficult
2021-05-30T21:36:46  <kevinf311-lap> i still don't know if my plan is going to actually work 
2021-05-30T21:37:34  <daftykins> not with that attitude! :D
2021-05-30T21:42:36  <kevinf311-lap> just lots of new devices to learn while simultaneously dredging up stuff learned years ago (some of which is obsolete)
2021-05-30T21:47:07  <daftykins> is it still fun, or has it lost that?
2021-05-30T21:49:44  <kevinf311-lap> somewhere in the middle lol
2021-05-30T21:49:57  <kevinf311-lap> i got a good chuckle when i logged back into the switch 
2021-05-30T21:50:21  <kevinf311-lap> as i had forgotten it, too, received a name in the Doctor Who universe 
2021-05-30T21:51:25  <daftykins> :)
2021-05-30T21:51:55  <daftykins> in that case the QNAP must be the tardis, roomy and full of holes
2021-05-30T21:53:57  <kevinf311-lap> haha, nah the laptop will be the tardis as it travels through space 
2021-05-30T21:54:23  <kevinf311-lap> NAS is the "library" from the episode where they encounter River Song 
2021-05-30T21:56:53  <daftykins> ah i'm not that familiar with the series
2021-05-30T21:57:29  <kevinf311-lap> it's good if you don't mind having to keep track of a zillion bits of in-universe trivia 
2021-05-30T21:57:53  <kevinf311-lap> and don't take the science bits too seriously as none of anything in that show makes a lick of sense 
2021-05-30T21:58:18  <daftykins> last i saw was with Jon Pertwee
2021-05-30T21:59:56  <kevinf311-lap> watching from Eccleston through Smith is probably a decent way to enjoy the new series 
2021-05-30T22:00:20  *** bazkie <bazkie!~bazkie@82-72-125-93.cable.dynamic.v4.ziggo.nl> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 268 seconds)
2021-05-30T22:00:37  <kevinf311-lap> and maybe threading in the Torchwood series as well (i think that show is actually an objectively better series, but it's not really as fantastical as Doctor WHo is)
2021-05-30T22:07:00  <daftykins> i've always been quite negative about it, British series like that are shot in sitcom framerates and i find them tough to take seriously
2021-05-30T22:07:24  <daftykins> it's like seeing amateurs on a stage or similar
2021-05-30T22:07:28  <kevinf311-lap> interesting 
2021-05-30T22:12:29  <daftykins> ok i had better sleep
2021-05-30T22:12:34  <daftykins> sun's coming up, HISS
2021-05-30T22:13:27  <kevinf311-lap> g'night!
2021-05-30T22:13:35  <daftykins> sleep well when y'do \o

2021-05-31T10:54:57  <ectospasm> bah, I join Libera and all my usual channels are in a different order.  It will take a while before muscle memory gets overwritten.
2021-05-31T10:56:46  <hoglahoo> what kind of client doesnt let you order your channels the way you want them?  smh
2021-05-31T10:57:52  <ectospasm> hoglahoo: I suppose I could, but I'd have to dig to figure out how to do that.
2021-05-31T10:58:10  <bazkie> irc clients are overly complicated!
2021-05-31T10:58:32  <waterytart> If this is the most complicated thing in your lives, congratulations. :D 
2021-05-31T10:58:34  <hoglahoo> I can sympathize!
2021-05-31T10:58:50  <bazkie> waterytart: no, that'd be setting up a mail server ':)
2021-05-31T10:59:26  <hoglahoo> you ever get so many complications that it feels like the next, smallest, most minor one might be the thing that does you in
2021-05-31T10:59:38  <bazkie> hahah
2021-05-31T10:59:43  <waterytart> i already went past that 
2021-05-31T10:59:54  <hoglahoo> xD  you have graduated
2021-05-31T10:59:57  <waterytart> ^

2021-05-31T11:01:58  <waterytart> although i might go put a stick in the wheel of the guy revving his dirtbike really loudly outside 
2021-05-31T11:02:30  <waterytart> if thats what you meant :D 
2021-05-31T11:03:54  <hoglahoo> I mean like take the kids by the feet and superman spinfling them out the door and lock it for a few hours, or hail a taxi and tell them to just drive until you say when
2021-05-31T11:05:02  <waterytart> lol
2021-05-31T11:05:13  <waterytart> it happens 
2021-05-31T11:06:12  <hoglahoo> good news, I cleared a clog in the master bath yesterday.  that's one more item off The List
2021-05-31T11:06:22  <waterytart> \o/
2021-05-31T11:07:53  <waterytart> a little bit ago i told my son we need to take the cover off the swamp cooler today but i dont have a ladder to get up on the roof
2021-05-31T11:08:00  <waterytart> he came back just now 'ok it's done'
2021-05-31T11:08:02  <waterytart> o.0
2021-05-31T11:08:08  <hoglahoo> nice!
2021-05-31T11:08:11  <hoglahoo> glad he didnt die
2021-05-31T11:08:26  <waterytart> lol like WTF did you do?! i dont wanna know on second thought
2021-05-31T11:09:26  <hoglahoo> stacked two stepladders
2021-05-31T11:09:44  <hoglahoo> climbed a power pole and shimmied across the electric line
2021-05-31T11:10:06  <hoglahoo> went through the hole in the roof nobody bothered to tell you about yet
2021-05-31T11:14:44  <hoglahoo> I was a little productive yesterday.  besides the clog, I also showed junior how to replace a flat, rotate the car tires, check various engine fluids, and we cleaned off the woefully corroded battery terminals.  I still need to print off the list of 'what to do when some oklahoma jackass driver hits your car'
2021-05-31T11:14:58  <hoglahoo> these are not things we spend much time doing historically
2021-05-31T11:22:25  <waterytart> lol
2021-05-31T11:22:46  <waterytart> nice work on the car stuff
2021-05-31T11:23:03  <waterytart> i should have my son pull my subaru engine and make him change the head gasket

2021-05-31T11:40:28  <daftykins> ectospasm: i set up a totally fresh client and joined channels one by one, then saved the layout :D (irssi) to preserve my ordering
2021-05-31T11:40:34  <daftykins> also wb!
2021-05-31T11:42:23  <ectospasm> I just converted my freenode setup in irc.conf (weechat) to libera.  I don't understand the new ordering, it's not exactly alphabetical.  Though related channels are next to each other.
2021-05-31T11:42:40  <ectospasm> I did have to turn on TLS, since I wasn't using that before.
2021-05-31T11:42:49  <ectospasm> I also figured out how to cloak myself.
2021-05-31T11:49:46  <daftykins> i'll miss my unique but totally irrelevant cloak from freenode
2021-05-31T11:50:04  <daftykins> ~daftykins@pdpc/supporter/21for7/daftykins
2021-05-31T11:52:03  <ectospasm> You can still get a cloak for organizations that have moved, but the default cloak looks better than the unaffiliated one.
2021-05-31T11:54:24  <ectospasm> Today is the first day we get to try our new pool!  Everything is ready!
2021-05-31T11:55:19  <daftykins> :O
2021-05-31T12:00:33  <waterytart> the kiddos want me to get a pool here , so that will be one of the next buys lol
2021-05-31T12:01:19  <ectospasm> This is our first summer in this house.  It only took about three weeks to get it ready.
2021-05-31T12:01:38  <ectospasm> It wasn't opened last year, so when they came to open it on May 8, we didn't know what to expect.
2021-05-31T12:01:51  <ectospasm> Our cover kept the light out, so it wasn't overgrown with algae.
2021-05-31T12:01:58  <waterytart> sweet 
2021-05-31T12:02:10  <ectospasm> It was actually in much better shape than we expected, to start off.
2021-05-31T12:02:16  <waterytart> not bad 
2021-05-31T12:02:22  <waterytart> it's really not that hard to clear up the water too 
2021-05-31T12:02:29  <ectospasm> And the company that opened our pool and took our cover to clean it and hold it for the summer was worthless.
2021-05-31T12:02:35  <waterytart> just a few shocks and rounds of chlorine 
2021-05-31T12:02:48  <waterytart> they usually are worthless :D it's better to learn for yourself. 
2021-05-31T12:02:53  <ectospasm> Pretty much.  And chlorine is expensive this year, due to the shortage.
2021-05-31T12:02:59  <waterytart> oh is it 
2021-05-31T12:03:00  <waterytart> damn 
2021-05-31T12:03:12  <waterytart> i always bought it in bulk once a year to offset costs
2021-05-31T12:03:20  <ectospasm> Opening and closing the pool is something we won't want to do, though.  That cover weighs like 400lbs.
2021-05-31T12:03:31  <waterytart> yup
2021-05-31T12:03:33  <waterytart>  they suuuuuck

2021-05-31T17:34:29  <Anastasius> Are they coming from Sweden?
2021-05-31T17:34:35  <waterytart> probably
2021-05-31T17:34:42  <waterytart> more likely burbank 
2021-05-31T17:35:13  <Anastasius> Portable A/C... there's a drain hose, right?
2021-05-31T17:35:21  <waterytart> it has a pan underneat
2021-05-31T17:35:22  <waterytart> h
2021-05-31T17:35:26  <waterytart> and vents to a window

2021-05-31T17:36:09  <waterytart> where can i get some decent beds / bases that wont charge me $200 for shipping
2021-05-31T17:36:12  <waterytart> that takes paypal
2021-05-31T17:37:03  <waterytart> and why doesn't amazon take paypal?!
2021-05-31T17:37:19  <Anastasius> These are good questions.
2021-05-31T17:37:45  <waterytart> the kids need new beds ... and the base is fucked up on the one 
2021-05-31T17:38:29  <daftykins> i wonder if we'll get some more heatwaves that would make me wish i invested in AC
2021-05-31T17:38:32  <waterytart> anyway the AC i have is this one https://www.amazon.com/Whynter-ARC-14S-Conditioner-Dehumidifier-Activated/dp/B0028AYQDC/ref=asc_df_B0028AYQDC/?
2021-05-31T17:38:57  <waterytart> that thing takes care of half the house.

2021-05-31T17:39:33  <waterytart> ive had that since i built that giant she-shed in florida :D 
2021-05-31T17:39:49  <waterytart> still works nicely even after all these moves lol 
2021-05-31T17:40:09  <Anastasius> She and her husband lived out in the country for years, probably before I was born, but they decided to sell off and get an apartment in town. No A/C there, so they got one of those.
2021-05-31T17:40:20  <waterytart> it's super simple
2021-05-31T17:40:29  <waterytart> has casters on the bottom to move easily too 
2021-05-31T17:40:33  <Anastasius> Yep.
2021-05-31T17:40:43  <waterytart> well worth the price for how long i've had it now 
2021-05-31T17:40:49  <waterytart> 5 years now? 
2021-05-31T17:41:01  <Anastasius> Nice.

2021-05-31T17:43:29  <Anastasius> Well at least if my A/C conks out again I know who to call... the tech guy who came out last year and fixed shit admirably and cheaply just lives 2 blocks up the street. :D

2021-05-31T17:45:47  <waterytart> also did you notice he's so CHONKY he barely fits
2021-05-31T17:45:56  <Anastasius> Close the drain before it actually gets plugged up with cat hair. :D
2021-05-31T17:46:09  <waterytart> haha
2021-05-31T17:46:15  <waterytart> it has a little screen
2021-05-31T17:46:25  <waterytart> oh wait. the screen is sitting on the counter :D 
2021-05-31T17:46:38  <daftykins> ruh roh
2021-05-31T17:47:21  <Anastasius> Oh I can't wait until the pug monsters are over again in a few weeks. I'm going to request I also borrow the Scion again so I can cart them around without getting hair all over the inside of my car.
2021-05-31T17:47:29  <waterytart> \o/
2021-05-31T17:47:34  <Anastasius> That's the least they can do.
2021-05-31T17:47:40  <waterytart> oh you should get a doggy liner 
2021-05-31T17:47:49  <waterytart> i'm getting one soon because ... Winter. oh god.
2021-05-31T17:48:06  <Anastasius> Shedding dogs shed a lot.
2021-05-31T17:48:12  <waterytart> the car rental company charged us extra because her hair was all over the back of the truck 
2021-05-31T17:48:26  <Anastasius> lol
2021-05-31T17:48:41  <waterytart> thats the first time ive had that happen and i have kids
2021-05-31T17:48:44  <Anastasius> That shit is hard to vacuum out, too.
2021-05-31T17:49:14  <waterytart> my son once shoved part of a hotdog into the window crevice and thought it was funny to ROLL IT DOWN 'to make the window eat the hot dog'
2021-05-31T17:49:17  <Anastasius> I mean, this time I might have them for 10 days.
2021-05-31T17:49:19  <waterytart> didn't charge me for that. 
2021-05-31T17:50:04  <waterytart> thats cool, i'm glad you'll get to have fun with that
2021-05-31T17:50:21  <waterytart> but really get a doggy liner :D

2021-05-31T19:33:08  <ectospasm> This is... an odd feeling.  I spent most of the afternoon in the sun taking my first dip in the pool.  I burn really easily, so I put on two coats of 50SPF sunscreen and then swam for about an hour or so.
2021-05-31T19:33:22  <ectospasm> I feel like I spent the day in the sun, but no pain from sunburn.
2021-05-31T19:33:34  <daftykins> :)
2021-05-31T19:34:02  <ectospasm> Normally I'd be burnt as fuck right now.
2021-05-31T19:35:01  <daftykins> i didn't think it was particularly bright the other day, sat outside reading for hours in direct sun, ended up lobster coloured come the evening
2021-05-31T19:35:56  <ectospasm> People burn worse when it's overcast.  I don't know how that works but it's true.
2021-05-31T19:36:25  <ectospasm> When I was 12 years old I got second degree burns from the sun, and it was overcast all day.
2021-05-31T19:36:32  <waterytart> haha whale done 
2021-05-31T19:36:44  <waterytart> you might be redder tomorrow too

2021-05-31T21:13:07  * Lando-SpacePimp giggles
2021-05-31T21:13:10  <Anastasius> It was cold.

2021-05-31T21:13:49  <NoCode> :D
2021-05-31T21:14:18  <NoCode> that took since like 5:30.

2021-05-31T21:14:31  <NoCode> I will.
2021-05-31T21:14:37  <Lando-SpacePimp> \o/

2021-05-31T21:15:07  <NoCode> This tuning rig is amazing
2021-05-31T21:15:11  <Anastasius> Cut it off at 10pm or so, you should be fine.
2021-05-31T21:15:19  <NoCode> Nah, I cut off at 8
2021-05-31T21:15:43  <NoCode> 9 or so on Friday-Saturday I think it was.
2021-05-31T21:15:50  <NoCode> Saturday*
2021-05-31T21:15:50  <tincan> Anastasius: did it work?
2021-05-31T21:16:18  <NoCode> I can't cut the noise at 10. That is too late lol
2021-05-31T21:16:31  <daftykins> i agree
2021-05-31T21:16:39  <NoCode> that lubricating oil worked fucking amazing
2021-05-31T21:16:51  <NoCode> it dialed in my snare nicely.
2021-05-31T21:16:54  <tincan> NoCode: it always does
2021-05-31T21:17:08  <NoCode> yeah alright
2021-05-31T21:18:49  <Anastasius> tincan: Did what work?
2021-05-31T21:19:01  <tincan> <Anastasius> tincan: Well I can't say too much about that since it hasn't happened. I did have a girlfriend once who did like having icecubes pushed up her twat with my dick though. Does that count?
2021-05-31T21:19:16  <NoCode> I can't believe I got everything dialed in.
2021-05-31T21:19:24  <Anastasius> Oh that. Yes, it worked. But she kept wanting more ice cubes.
2021-05-31T21:19:25  <NoCode> I should probably write down numbers for next time.
2021-05-31T21:19:42  <NoCode> That way I can be deadpan accurate.
2021-05-31T21:20:59  <Lando-SpacePimp> Anastasius, should've built her a snowman
2021-05-31T21:21:17  <daftykins> i like to imagine she just had a thing for Ice Cube
2021-05-31T21:22:02  <Anastasius> I like to imagine she wasn't a fucknut. We got along pretty well, and she wasn't into arson.
2021-05-31T21:22:49  <Anastasius> What broke us up, I wonder. I need to think about that one.
2021-05-31T21:23:07  <Lando-SpacePimp> don't hurt yourself
2021-05-31T21:23:38  <tincan> given the icecube thing she may have been a frost giant
2021-05-31T21:24:00  <Lando-SpacePimp> since when was Memorial Day a day for fireworks?
2021-05-31T21:24:10  <Lando-SpacePimp> I thought it was supposed to be somber
2021-05-31T21:24:24  <Anastasius> I think it was because I was over at a friend's place one night getting baked without her, and then I came home and had to eat a whole shitload of spaghetti and she was pissed that she wasn't invited, but she was also at work at the time.
2021-05-31T21:25:12  <daftykins> hrmm 
2021-05-31T21:25:16  <daftykins> that'd be rather petty
2021-05-31T21:25:27  <Anastasius> It was another girl type friend I was getting baked with, but we didn't have any sort of deal going on.
2021-05-31T21:27:01  <Anastasius> So I guess it was a jealousy/trust issue. Again.
2021-05-31T21:28:22  <Anastasius> Me? I wasn't really in the mood for it much at the time, so my reaction was basically "SHOO"
2021-05-31T21:29:33  <tincan> Anastasius: are you still eating shitloads of spagetti?
2021-05-31T21:29:53  <Anastasius> tincan: no, it binds my colon now.
2021-05-31T21:30:01  <NoCode> I'm hungry af
2021-05-31T21:30:07  <NoCode> I never ate dinner
2021-05-31T21:30:18  <tincan> NoCode: eating might solve those problems
2021-05-31T21:30:41  <NoCode> Well, tuning drums was more important.
2021-05-31T21:30:53  <tincan> NoCode: well, eat now!
2021-05-31T21:31:02  <Anastasius> NoCode: Drum set is on point now?
2021-05-31T21:32:19  <NoCode> I think so. I gotta play them tomorrow to see how they sound. The resonance is matching at least now. It was hard because the high tom is 12", the low tom is 13", floor is 16". So the first iteration, I had them too high.
2021-05-31T21:32:33  <NoCode> Then I tuned them down a few notches, and it was still too high.
2021-05-31T21:32:45  <NoCode> Then the high and low tom sounded the same.
2021-05-31T21:33:12  <Anastasius> Record something if you want to.
2021-05-31T21:33:13  <NoCode> Then it was still too high. So I got them set lower, and sounding differently.
2021-05-31T21:33:26  <NoCode> I plan to
2021-05-31T21:33:43  <NoCode> I bought another mic stand, and a double kick pedal tonight.
2021-05-31T21:33:54  <NoCode> So I can set up two good mics
2021-05-31T21:34:01  <Anastasius> :D
2021-05-31T21:34:06  <Anastasius> Nice
2021-05-31T21:34:24  <NoCode> I just need to format my laptop and get Mixbus on it.
2021-05-31T21:34:42  <NoCode> I was asking in #ardour how I should set up without phasing issues.
2021-05-31T21:35:11  <NoCode> They suggested overhead behind me, and one above the snare
2021-05-31T21:36:46  <NoCode> They pro audio techs in there who work on Ardour, and Harrison. Some of the same people work on both. Except Mixbus is built on Ardour, but has famous shit added to it that has made their consoles be some of the best in the business.
2021-05-31T21:37:24  <Anastasius> Ardour has always been a good project.
2021-05-31T21:38:23  <NoCode> Like good tube emulation built right into the software.
2021-05-31T21:38:44  <NoCode> And better dialed in EQs and shit
2021-05-31T21:38:56  <NoCode> It's some of the best software I've used
2021-05-31T21:39:32  <NoCode> Mixbus is built so you can use JACK(Like ardour) and in Windows it's just as solid as doing it in Linux
2021-05-31T21:39:43  <Lando-SpacePimp> JACK HOFF
2021-05-31T21:40:25  <NoCode> Can't believe how good my snare sounds now. :D
2021-05-31T21:44:08  <NoCode> The best part is, I never knew anything about tuning before. I only helped my brother once change the heads on his CZX studio Pearl set, but I didn't really do much.
2021-05-31T21:44:23  <NoCode> New skills ftw
2021-05-31T21:45:29  <NoCode> Each lug is within a 32nd of a tonal variance in tension. :D

2021-06-01T03:38:47  <kn100> my stupid bluetooth scale app has no way to export the data, so I wrote effectively a screen scraper. I take a screenshot of the scale up.

2021-06-01T03:41:48  <bazkie> that's pretty cool, u use opencv?
2021-06-01T03:42:06  <kn100> I used a Go lib called Gosseract, along with some other image processing libs
2021-06-01T03:42:58  <kn100> essentially the image gets cut up into the squares which contain the numbers I care about, and each image is run through Gosseract (which itself uses tesseract) with a pretty strict whitelist about what it should 'see', so the results are pretty accurate. Occasional error here and there but not difficult to manually correct
2021-06-01T03:43:31  <kn100> and the errors are almost always stuff like detecting 2 periods rather than 1. I reckon I can improve this further with some more image processing (increasing the contrast and what not)
2021-06-01T03:47:40  <kn100> plan is to make it somewhat more generic and configurable so I can maintain a repo with configs for various smart scales, so others can use it too - since it seems pretty endemic a problem. There is Openscale - an OSS project to develop a completely OSS app for connecting to BLE scales, but the support is very limited, and this approach is a nice

2021-06-01T03:56:55  <kn100> Honestly the only metric I really care about is weight, everything else I only care about trends really. It's more the principle of it jip, GIMME MY DATA IT IS MINE
2021-06-01T03:59:22  <jip> kn100: Does it give a good representation of your fitness?
2021-06-01T03:59:38  <jip> I've been wondering this ever since I stepped onto the scale at my gym
2021-06-01T03:59:51  <kn100> jip reasonably good, the metrics are all trending in the direction I'd expect them to given my recent lifestyle changes
2021-06-01T04:00:04  <jip> nice
2021-06-01T04:00:24  <kn100> My wife is fitness mad and the scale very much agrees, which gives me some confidence in its data
2021-06-01T04:01:54  <kn100> I have always been pretty slobbish when it comes to personal fitness/health, and lockdown really didn't help - hence recently a decision to make a substantial change to my diet and to head to the gym fairly frequently (mostly to slow down muscle loss from such an intense diet!)

2021-06-01T04:02:43  <jip> The gyms have just opened again here, but I haven't been there yet
2021-06-01T04:03:10  <jip> their showers are still closed, hopefully they will open again soon too
2021-06-01T04:03:45  <jip> We used to go as a family, but I am not sure we will pick up on that again
2021-06-01T04:07:18  <jip> The scale at the fitness club only made me depressed XD Even when I felt fitter it said I lost muscles. So I was wondering if it was acurate. And my body age... way higher than my real age. While I don't feel llike that.
2021-06-01T04:29:23  <kn100> I can't speak to your fitness specifically, but assuming your goal is weight loss, muscle loss is practically inevitable 
2021-06-01T04:29:33  <kn100> what matters more is that you lose fat faster than muscle :D
2021-06-01T04:29:52  <kn100> if you're eating at a calorie deficit, your gym visits aren't going to be doing much for muscle growth
2021-06-01T04:30:50  <jip> I am happy I've lost some weight, but it was not a goal
2021-06-01T04:31:01  <jip> My weight is ok
2021-06-01T04:31:08  <jip> now
2021-06-01T04:31:27  <kn100> then you'll want to pivot your diet to increase your protein intake pretty dramatically. Muscle is built in the kitchen mostly
2021-06-01T04:31:39  <kn100> plus muscle growth is a slow process
2021-06-01T04:32:24  <jip>  I am not sure I want muscle growth either :-) I just want to be fit
2021-06-01T04:34:46  <jip> I do want to be able to do pull ups at some point. 
2021-06-01T04:35:34  <jip> I train for the zombie apocalypse. Pull ups are a needed skill ;-)
2021-06-01T04:41:04  <kn100> I am tracking my personal goal very closely currently

2021-06-01T05:34:15  <kn100> it's actually not proving to be that difficult. Not sponsored or anything but huel.com meal replacement once a day makes it surprisingly easy, given that it's very filling. Aiming for 1300kcal a day, since maintenance for me is somewhere around 1800kcal-2000kcal, so that should result in around 1kg a week, which is quick, but it's the only form of
2021-06-01T05:34:16  <kn100> diet that I've found works or me. I don't tend to put weight on anymore. So a short sharp 10kg off every now and then is what's gotten me from 116kg down to the 84 or so I am now

2021-06-01T09:13:58  <kn100> bazkie if you're curious, here's a little demo I prepared. I took a FLAC source, and compressed it intentionally poorly with mp3, and intentionally well with ogg. The difference being I used 'standard' stereo encoding for the mp3, and 'joint' stereo encoding for the ogg. This effectively means that not only is ogg a superior format anyway, but it
2021-06-01T09:13:58  <kn100> also has a bit less than double the bandwidth to work with: https://nextcloud.kn100.me/s/Yj6J5tm7pNrSYcx?

2021-06-01T18:38:06  <NoCode> Playing along Derek trucks. Doing shuffles and shit. Back beats with ghost notes, doing shuffles on the hihat and ride cymbal

2021-06-01T18:44:41  <kevinf311-lap> daftykins: i like it! though i don't quite understand what that extra building is for
2021-06-01T18:46:02  <NoCode> the rims shots are doing completely different than the bass drum while the hats keep chugging
2021-06-01T18:46:10  <daftykins> well you have to house your butler somewhere

2021-06-01T18:55:07  <Anastasius> Is it wrong I stole a putter from a mini-golf place by shoving it down my pants and pretending I had a bum leg?
2021-06-01T18:55:17  <Anastasius> It's still in my golf bag.
2021-06-01T18:55:31  <genii> Yes
2021-06-01T18:57:21  <kevinf311-lap> i feel like mini-golf putters are sorta terrible for putting, but I'm also pretty terrible at golf but rather phenomenal at mini-golf... so perhaps not
2021-06-01T18:58:07  <Anastasius> I haven't golfed in probably 20 years anyway.
2021-06-01T18:58:24  <Anastasius> And was always terrible at it.

2021-06-02T09:38:18  <kn100> Lol a muslim friend of mine who I've done some traveling with (specifically we went to Austria together) messaged me to let me know the right wing nutjobs in Austria had started putting up signs that say "Political islam in this area, see more on a map". 
2021-06-02T09:38:54  <kn100> The signs look like this: https://mobile.twitter.com/NinaHoraczek/status/1399992913371729920/photo/1. My reply was "But where did they get your photo though?"
2021-06-02T09:39:53  <kn100> Traveling with him was super eye opening. Watching him get selected for "random" searches every single time was absolutely depressing. Man couldn't hurt a fly hahaha
2021-06-02T09:56:23  <jip> kn100: lol
2021-06-02T09:56:30  <jip> yeah, very sad
2021-06-02T09:56:48  <kn100> I can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of it all
2021-06-02T09:59:38  <jip> You are in Germany?

2021-06-02T10:09:47  <jip> It is a nice place to visit as a tourist
2021-06-02T10:10:04  <kn100> jip - It's alright. I'm originally from a much smaller town in Wales, famous only for its suicides (I wish I was joking)
2021-06-02T10:10:37  <jip> Any specific type of suicide?
2021-06-02T10:10:41  <kn100> I am planning on getting out to Canada as soon as possible though, soon as immigration programs open up. Nothings keeping me here anymore. It's a good place to live in a lot of regards, but I've just gotten so jaded living in the UK

2021-06-02T10:13:02  <kn100> heh, thankfully nobody close to me went that way -but I've got close friends and family members who had friends/family that went
2021-06-02T10:13:10  <jip> Why Canada? Why not something closer... like Europe ;-D
2021-06-02T10:13:19  <kn100> The media was the absolute WORST at the time though
2021-06-02T10:14:06  <kn100> Why Canada? It needs to be english speaking (not so much for me, but my wife, who is a historian who speaks 4 languages, but the other 3 are for countries she'd never consider living in again :P), and we picked Canada because of its proximity to the US and its relatively decent immigration system
2021-06-02T10:16:04  <jip> We speak English in the Netherlands
2021-06-02T10:24:33  <jip> Canada is nice. I've seen pictures

2021-06-02T21:30:03  <NoCode> I always wish when you "eject media" or USB drive, that the thing would just fly across the room while it ejects. Because when you use a CD ROM, ask it to eject, the tray opens

2021-06-02T21:36:47  <kevinf311-lap> we had laptops that you could eject the HDD from
2021-06-02T21:37:08  <kevinf311-lap> they had a little screw that would hold them but that was gone immediately 
2021-06-02T21:37:51  <kevinf311-lap> so sometimes you'd set the laptop down and fire the hard drive across the table
2021-06-02T21:38:38  <NoCode> this install better not remind me that the installation medium is corrupted at the *end* of the install again. lmao

2021-06-02T21:46:58  <gav> I literally couldn't save the metadata because of the format of the database

2021-06-02T21:49:24  * NoCode waits to get banned for bot abuse
2021-06-02T21:49:45  <gav> NoCode: I actually had to completely rewrite the entire schema, and some stuff was just not in a compatible format, like the author field in the new database is an int for the user number, not the nick of the person who made it
2021-06-02T21:50:10  <NoCode> ah
2021-06-02T21:50:31  <gav> It's kind of amazing I was able to migrate the factoids themselves
2021-06-02T21:51:11  <gav> Especially since the new plugin didn't support things like !piping and alias factoids
